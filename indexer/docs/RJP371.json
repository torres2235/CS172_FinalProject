Newsom\u2019s 2021-22 revised budget\t\t \n \n The University of California is deeply grateful to Gov. Newsom for proposing the largest state investment in UC\u2019s history: more than $807 million, which includes more than $506 million in ongoing funding for core campus operations, student needs and medical training. The budget, with the support of legislative leadership, reflects an earlier agreement to fully restore more than $300 million in budget reductions that were enacted in the 2020 state budget. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n @UofCalifornia \n \n \n . @ucriverside  historian Jorge Leal has taken a furtive step into documenting the Latinx community\u2019s emerging L.A. f\u2026  https://t.co/3GVXgmYXtB   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Priorities Spotlight Double the Pell \n Defending DACA recipients \n Civic Engagement \n Climate Lab \n Fig. 1 \n FirstGen \n Innovation and Entrepreneurship \n Student Opportunity \n Transfer Students \n \n Systemwide Programs UC-HBCU Initiative Programs \n President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program \n \n Presidential Initiatives Carbon Neutrality Initiative \n Global Food Initiative \n Smoke and Tobacco-Free Student Fellowships \n UC-Mexico Initiative \n UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement \n Undocumented Students Initiative \n \n \n UC System Overview \n Parts of UC \n Stewardship \n Working at UC \n Leadership Academic Senate \n Board of Regents \n \n Information Center \n \n Support UC Advocate About the UC Advocacy Network \n UCAN Student Ambassadors \n Federal Budget \n State Budget \n Research Funding \n Enrollment \n Education \n Campus Housing \n Health Care \n Student & Faculty Diversity \n \n Donate \n Connect Alumni Career Network \n \n \n More \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Become a UC Advocate \n \n Receive email alerts about issues that are important to UC and contact your legislators to ensure the university remains a hub of opportunity, excellence, and innovation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Admissions \n Jobs \n Contact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Facebook \n Twitter \n Tumblr \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Double the Pell \n Double the Pell \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Email your lawmaker \n to Double the Pell! \n \n \n Ask Congress to reinvest in Pell Grants \n \n \n Learn more about the Double the Pell campaign to increase federal financial aid for low-income students \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n UC Newsletter \n Subscribe to get the latest headlines from the University of California. \n Email Address   \n \n \n \n \n \n Subscribe \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Admissions \n \n Learn more about applying as an undergraduate, or explore your options for graduate study at UC. \n Undergraduate \n \n \n Graduate \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n Campuses \n UC Berkeley \n UC Davis \n UC Irvine \n UCLA \n UC Merced \n UC Riverside \n UC San Diego \n UC San Francisco \n UC Santa Barbara \n UC Santa Cruz \n Medical Centers, labs and locations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Working at UC \n \n Be a part of this vibrant institution. \n Read More  about working at UC \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Accountability \n \n UC is accountable to the people of California for how well it performs. \n Read the report \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Viewing: All News \n \n All News \n Research \n Health \n Arts & Humanities \n Students & Alumni \n Faculty & Staff \n Administration \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The invincible Class of 2021 \n They weathered an extraordinary year and have come out stronger. \n \n \n \n UC Newsroom \n \n Student Opportunity ,             Students and Alumni   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The COVID vaccine came out super quickly.
