Answering the questions in the template to create your plan. \u00a0It is helpful to answering the questions on the \"Data Management Plans\" tab prior to using the DMPTool. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Journals and Publishers\n                                 \n \n \n \n Many publishers require that data which supports the underlying research reported in an article be made available to any reader of the journal which publishes the article. \u00a0These requirements are not always posted on the Information For Authors page; look in other areas if a data sharing requirement isn\u2019t readily apparent. Publishers also sometimes recommend repositories for data in different disciplines; this is useful if you are not familiar with repositories in your field. \n Data sharing policies for Science and Nature \n \n Science: Data Availability \n Nature: Scientific Data\u00a0Policies \n Nature: Open Access Policies \n Nature:\u00a0Availability of Materials and Data \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n National Institutes of Health\n                                 \n \n \n \n NIH does not require a full data management plan, but one section of a regular DMP: sharing data. \u00a0Current research applications requesting $500,000 or more of direct costs in any single year are expected to include a plan for sharing final research data for research purposes, or state why data sharing is not possible. \u00a0The plan must state how the applicant will maintain and protect the rights and confidentiality of participants, if human subjects are involved. \n \n NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance \n NIH Data Sharing Policy\u00a0 \n Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Data Sharing  (last revised 2019) \n \n \n NIH is moving toward an integrated data-ecosystem. \n \n NIH: Office of Data Science Strategy \n NIH\u2019s Strategic Vision for Data Science: Enabling a FAIR-Data Ecosystem  (also,  adapted presentation ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n National Science Foundation\n                                 \n \n \n \n National Science Foundation \n NSF requires that all current proposals include a Data Management Plan as a supplementary document, to be no more than two pages, to conform to their data sharing policy. \u00a0Investigators are expected to share data, samples, and supporting materials created or gathered during NSF funded research ( Award & Administration Guide (AAG) Chapter VI.D.4 ). \n NSF has three levels of DMP requirements: \u00a0Directorate, division, or unit specific;  Grant Proposal Guide \u00a0which must be followed if guidance specific to the program is not provided; and Program Solicitation guidance which must be followed if provided.\u00a0 \n \n NSF General DMP Policy \n Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Public Access \n \n Directorate Guidance \n Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO) \n \n Directorate-wide Guidance \u00a0(posted Feburary 2018) \n \n Computer & Information Sciences & Engineering (CISE) \n \n Directorate-wide Guidance \u00a0(last revised\u00a0April 2018) \n \n Education & Human Resources Directorate (EHR) \n \n Directorate-wide Guidance  (Effective January 2018, posted September 2017) \n \n Engineering Directorate (ENG) \n \n Directorate-wide Guidance  (last revised\u00a0November 2018) \n \n Geosciences Directorate (GEO) \n \n Directorate-wide Guidance  (last revised\u00a0February 2018) \n \n Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS) \n \n Division of Astronomical Sciences \u00a0(last revised January 2018) \n Division of Chemistry \u00a0(last revised January 2018) \n Division of Materials Research \u00a0(last revised January 2018) \n Division of Mathematical Sciences \u00a0(last revised January 2018) \n Division of Physics \u00a0(last revised January 2018) \n \n Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate (SBE) \n \n Directorate-wide Guidance \u00a0(last revised April 2018) \n \n \n docs last checked: 20190729 kek \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n NIST\n                                 \n \n \n \n Policies, Directives, and NIST's Public Access Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n National Endowment for the Humanities\n                                 \n \n \n \n \n Data isn\u2019t generated only in the sciences! \u00a0Digital Humanities projects also create and collect data. \u00a0NEH has a DMP requirement for proposals and awards. \u00a0NEH provides sample grant narratives from successful ODH applications, which include DMPs, and guidelines for DMP creation. \u00a0 \n \n Data Management Plans for NEH Office of Digital Humanities Proposals and Awards \n\t\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dept of Ed: Institute of Education Services\n                                 \n \n \n \n IES has policy requiring DMPs with all current grant applications. \u00a0Data sharing is currently required for Goal 4 Effectiveness and Goal 3 Efficacy and Replication grants. \u00a0In\u00a0FY2016, IES included a requirement for data sharing for the Research Networks on Critical Problems of Policy and Practice competition. \n \n IES Policy Regarding Public Access to Research \n Policy Statement on Public Access to Data Resulting from IES Funded Grants \n Implementation Guide for Public Access to Research Data \n Frequently Asked Questions About Providing Public Access To Data \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n US Department of Energy\n                                 \n \n \n \n \n The DOE requires that all proposals submitted to the Office of Science for research finding including a Data Management Plan (DMP).
