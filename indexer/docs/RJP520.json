As a user navigates between\n  web pages, Google Analytics provides website owners JavaScript tags\n  (libraries) to record information about the page a user has seen, for example\n  the URL of the page. \n The Google Analytics JavaScript libraries use  HTTP cookies  to \"remember\"\n  what a user has done on previous pages / interactions with the website. \n Note:  Read the  Google Analytics privacy  document for more\ndetails about the data collected by Google Analytics. \n Google Analytics supports three JavaScript libraries (tags) for measuring\nwebsite usage:  gtag.js ,  analytics.js , and  ga.js .\nThe following sections describe how each library use cookies for\n Universal Analytics  and  Google Analytics 4 , where applicable. \n gtag.js (Google Analytics 4) - cookie usage \n For  Google Analytics 4 , the  gtag.js JavaScript library  uses\n first-party  cookies to: \n \n Distinguish unique users \n Distinguish sessions for a user \n \n When using the  recommended JavaScript snippet  cookies are set at the\nhighest possible domain level. For example, if your website address is\n blog.example.co.uk , gtag.js will set the cookie domain to\n .example.co.uk . Setting cookies on the highest level domain possible allows\nmeasurement to occur across subdomains without any extra configuration. \n Note:  gtag.js does not require setting cookies to transmit data to Google\nAnalytics. \n gtag.js sets the following cookies: \n \n \n \n Cookie name \n Default expiration time \n Description \n \n \n \n \n _ga \n 2 years \n Used to distinguish users. \n \n \n _gid \n 24 hours \n Used to distinguish users. \n \n \n _ga_<container-id> \n 2 years \n Used to persist session state. \n \n \n _gac_gb_<container-id> \n 90 days \n \n      Contains campaign related information. If you have\n      linked your Google Analytics and Google Ads accounts, Google Ads\n      website conversion tags will read this cookie unless you opt-out.\n       Learn more .\n     \n \n \n \n Customization \n Read the gtag.js  Cookies and user identification guide (GA4)  to\nlearn how these default settings can be customized with gtag.js. \n gtag.js and analytics.js (Universal Analytics) - cookie usage \n The  analytics.js JavaScript library  or the\n gtag.js JavaScript library  can be used for  Universal Analytics . In\nboth cases, the libraries use  first-party  cookies to: \n \n Distinguish unique users \n Throttle the request rate \n \n When using the  recommended JavaScript snippet  cookies are set at the\nhighest possible domain level. For example, if your website address is\n blog.example.co.uk , analytics.js and gtag.js will set the cookie domain to\n .example.co.uk . Setting cookies on the highest level domain possible allows\nmeasurement to occur across subdomains without any extra configuration. \n Note:  gtag.js and analytics.js do not require setting cookies to transmit data\nto Google Analytics. \n gtag.js and analytics.js set the following cookies: \n \n \n Cookie Name \n Default expiration time \n Description \n \n \n _ga \n 2 years \n Used to distinguish users. \n \n \n _gid \n 24 hours \n Used to distinguish users. \n \n \n _gat \n 1 minute \n Used to throttle request rate. If Google Analytics is deployed via\n      Google Tag Manager, this cookie will be named  _dc_gtm_<property-\n      id> . \n \n \n AMP_TOKEN \n 30 seconds to 1 year \n Contains a token that can be used to retrieve a Client ID from AMP\n    Client ID service. Other possible values indicate opt-out, inflight request\n    or an error retrieving a Client ID from AMP Client ID service. \n \n \n _gac_<property-id> \n 90 days \n \n      Contains campaign related information for the user. If you have\n      linked your Google Analytics and Google Ads accounts, Google Ads\n      website conversion tags will read this cookie unless you opt-out.\n       Learn more .\n     \n \n \n Customization \n Read the gtag.js\n Cookies and user identification guide (Universal Analytics)  to\nlearn how these default settings can be customized with gtag.js. \n Read the analytics.js  Domains and Cookies developer guide  to learn all the\nways these default settings can be customized with analytics.js. \n Read the  Security and privacy in Universal Analytics  document for more\ninformation about Universal Analytics and cookies. \n ga.js - cookie usage \n The  ga.js JavaScript library  uses  first-party  cookies to: \n \n Determine which domain to measure \n Distinguish unique users \n Throttle the request rate \n Remember the number and time of previous visits \n Remember traffic source information \n Determine the start and end of a session \n Remember the value of visitor-level custom variables \n \n By default, this library sets cookies on the domain specified in\n  the  document.host  browser property\n  and sets the cookie path to the root level  (/) .\nThis library sets the following cookies: \n \n \n Cookie Name \n Default Expiration Time \n Description \n \n \n __utma \n 2 years from set/update \n Used to distinguish users and sessions. The cookie is created\n      when the javascript library executes and no existing\n      __utma cookies exists. The cookie is updated every time data is\n      sent to Google Analytics. \n \n \n __utmt \n 10 minutes \n Used to throttle request rate. \n \n \n __utmb \n 30 mins from set/update \n Used to determine new sessions/visits. The cookie is created\n      when the javascript library executes and no existing\n      __utmb cookies exists. The cookie is updated every time data is\n      sent to Google Analytics. \n \n \n __utmc \n End of browser session \n Not used in ga.js. Set for interoperability with urchin.js.\n      Historically, this cookie operated in conjunction\n      with the  __utmb  cookie to determine whether\n      the user was in a new session/visit. \n \n \n __utmz \n 6 months from set/update \n Stores the traffic source or campaign that explains how\n      the user reached your site. The cookie is created\n      when the javascript library executes and is updated every\n      time data is sent to Google Analytics. \n \n \n __utmv \n 2 years from set/update \n Used to store visitor-level custom variable data.\n      This cookie is created when a developer uses the  \n _setCustomVar  method with\n      a visitor level custom variable. This cookie was\n      also used for the deprecated  _setVar  method. The cookie is\n      updated every time data is sent to Google Analytics. \n \n \n Customization \n The following methods can be used to customize how cookies are set: \n \n _setDomainName  - Sets the domain to which all cookies will be set. \n _setCookiePath  - Sets the path to which all cookies will be set. \n _setVisitorCookieTimeout  - Sets the Google Analytics visitor cookie expiration in milliseconds. \n _setSessionCookieTimeout  - Sets the new session cookie timeout in milliseconds. \n _setCampaignCookieTimeout  - Sets the campaign cookie expiration time in milliseconds. \n _storeGac  - Pass in  false  to disable the GAC cookie. Defaults to  true \n \n Read the  Tracking Multiple Domains  guide to learn how to\nconfigure ga.js to measure user interaction across domains. \n urchin.js - cookie usage \n Historically, Google Analytics provided a JavaScript measurement\n  library named urchin.js. When the newer ga.js library launched, developers\n  were encouraged to migrate to the new library. For sites that have not\n  completed the migration, urchin.js sets cookies identically to what is\n  set in ga.js. Read the  ga.js  cookie usage section above\n  for more details. \n Google Analytics for Display Advertisers - cookie usage \n For customers that are using  Google Analytics' Display Advertiser\nfeatures , such as  remarketing , a\n third-party  DoubleClick cookie is used in addition to the other cookies\ndescribed in this document for just these features. For more information about\nthis cookie, visit the  Google Advertising Privacy FAQ . \n Content Experiments - cookie usage \n For websites using Google Analytics\n content experiments , the following cookies are\nused for these features in addition to the other cookies described in this\ndocument: \n \n \n Cookie Name \n Default expiration time \n Description \n \n \n __utmx \n 18 months \n Used to determine a user's inclusion in an experiment. \n \n \n __utmxx \n 18 months \n Used to determine the expiry of experiments a user has been included\n      in. \n \n \n Optimize - cookie usage \n For websites using  Optimize , the following cookies are used in addition to the\nother cookies described in this document: \n \n \n Cookie Name \n Default expiration time \n Description \n \n \n _gaexp \n Depends on the length of the experiment, but typically 90 days.  \n Used to determine a user's inclusion in an experiment and the expiry of experiments a user\n      has been included in. \n \n \n _opt_awcid \n 24 hours \n Used for campaigns mapped to Google Ads Customer IDs. \n \n \n _opt_awmid \n 24 hours \n Used for campaigns mapped to Google Ads  Campaign IDs. \n \n \n _opt_awgid \n 24 hours \n Used for campaigns mapped to Google Ads  Ad Group IDs \n \n \n _opt_awkid \n 24 hours \n Used for campaigns mapped to Google Ads Criterion IDs \n \n \n _opt_utmc \n 24 hours \n Stores the last  utm_campaign  query parameter. \n \n \n _opt_expid \n 10 seconds \n This cookie is created when running a redirect experiment. It stores the\n      experiment ID, the variant ID and the referrer to the page that's being\n      redirected. \n \n \n Note:  Optimize is not compatible with ga.js and gtag.js (Google Analytics 4)\nimplementations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the  Apache 2.0 License .
