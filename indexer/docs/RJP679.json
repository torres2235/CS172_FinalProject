Go to Ads Manager Measure cross-device conversions Understand how your cross-device ads help influence conversions. Optimize delivery to people likely to take action Ensure your ads are shown to the people most likely to take action. Create custom audiences from website visitors Dynamic ads  help you automatically show website visitors the products they viewed on your website\u2014or related ones. Learn about your website traffic Get rich insights about how people use your website from your Facebook pixel dashboard. How the Facebook pixel works When someone visits your website and takes an action (for example, buying something), the Facebook pixel is triggered and reports this action. This way, you'll know when a customer took an action after seeing your Facebook ad. You'll also be able to reach this customer again by using a custom audience. When more and more conversions happen on your website, Facebook gets better at delivering your ads to people who are more likely to take certain actions. This is called conversion optimization. Once we had Facebook conversion tracking in place and started using Custom Audiences, we saw a huge uplift in sales. Facebook ads became ROI-positive for us, from day one! Amy Norman Co-founder,  Little Passports Setting up the Facebook pixel If you have access to your website's code, you can add the Facebook pixel yourself. Simply place the Facebook pixel base code (what you see when you create your pixel) on all pages of your website. Then add standard events to the pixel code on the special pages of your website, such as your add-to-cart page or your purchase page. For full step-by-step instructions on adding the Facebook pixel to your site, visit the  Help Center .  Many people need the help of a developer to complete this step. If that's the case, simply email your Facebook pixel code to them, and they can easily add it to your site. Create your Facebook pixel to send to your developer, or install it yourself.
