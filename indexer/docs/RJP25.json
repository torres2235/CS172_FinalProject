Within 24-72 hours you will receive a notification email that the material is ready to be picked up.  Directions , phone number, and other details will be included in the email. \n You will drive up, call the library staff, and they will bring your books and place them in your trunk. Please have your UCR ID ready to show through the car window. \n \n \u00a0 \n This service is available for UCR faculty, students, and staff, as well as those from other UC campuses who are located closer to Riverside. You may also walk (bike, skateboard, etc.) up to use this service, as long as you wear a mask and observe social distancing. \n To return items, you may use the book drops outside the Rivera or Orbach Libraries at any time. Patrons who are picking up materials may also return books at the Rivera loading dock. \n The physical libraries are still closed to the public, other than this drive-up service.\u00a0  See  Library Resources and Services for Remote Users . \n Exceptions \n Books that are available digitally through the  HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service  are not available for Curbside Pickup. In order for UCR (and the other UC campuses) to keep this HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access, we cannot loan any of those books if they are in our library. However, approximately half our UCR collection is available for Curbside Delivery. \n Other materials not available for Curbside Pickup include physical Course Reserves, physical Interlibrary Loan (ILL) items, and materials from Special Collections and University Archives (SCUA). However, patrons may request digitized reproductions of SCUA items  here .\u00a0 \n Health and Safety \n The library prioritizes the health and safety of our staff and library patrons. \n \n We require all library staff and patrons to wear masks while in the building, or during Curbside Delivery. \n We require all library staff and patrons to practice physical distancing of at least 6 feet. \n Library staff will wear gloves when handling, processing, and delivering books to library patrons. \n Returned items will be quarantined for 72 hours before being returned to the shelves. \n Library staff regularly practice recommended hygiene practices (hand washing for 20 seconds, use of sanitizer, wiping down commonly used surfaces, etc.). \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \n Related Information \n \n Directions to the Rivera Library Loading Dock \n   \n \n \n \n \n Sign up for UCR Library News \n Click here to sign up today! \n \n \n Past Newsletters \n Click here to view the newsletter archive \n \n \n Share \n \n \n \n Contact \n \n Vincent Novoa \n Head of Access Services \n (951) 827-7309 \n Email \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n \n \n Hours \n Directory Departments & Services \n Staff \n \n News \n Publications Newsletters \n Strategic Plan \n \n Exhibits \n Workshops & Events \n FAQs \n Policies \n Jobs \n Directions, Parking, Mailing Address \n Giving to the Library \n Service Notifications \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Libraries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tom\u00e1s Rivera Library   \n \n            (951) 827-3220           \n \n \n \n Orbach Science Library   \n \n            (951) 827-3701           \n \n \n \n Special Collections & University Archives   \n \n            (951) 827-3233           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quick Links \n \n Student Disability Resource Center \n Directions & Parking \n Campus Safety Escort Services \n Jobs \n Privacy Policy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Follow \n \n Twitter \n Facebook \n YouTube \n Instagram \n Give to the Library \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a9 2020\u00a0Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Using the Library Borrow, Renew, Return Borrowing & Renewing \n Returning \n Borrowing Course Reserves \n Electronic Document Delivery \n Paging Service \n Fines & Fees \n Appeal Your Bills \n \n Getting a Library Card \n Borrowing Privileges \n Technology & Equipment Print, Copy, Scan \n Equipment \n Software on Public Computers \n Wireless Access \n Connect from Off-Campus \n \n Study Spaces \n Interlibrary Loan How to Use My ILL Requests \n Institutional Lending \n \n Disability Services \n Resources for Remote Users \n \n Research Support Getting Started Learn About Research Fundamentals \n How Do I Find?
