Like iCloud Keychain, which securely stores and autofills your passwords across all your devices. If a password breach is detected, Password Monitoring alerts you. Safari also notifies you when it encounters suspicious websites and prevents them from loading. And because it loads each web page in a separate process, any harmful code is always confined to a single browser tab so it won\u2019t crash the entire application or access your data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Password Monitoring \n \n \n \n If your password is involved in a data breach, Password Monitoring alerts you and helps you change your password. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More about password security \n \n \n \n Password Monitoring \n \n Safari automatically keeps an eye out for any saved passwords that may have been involved in a data breach. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, Safari periodically checks a derivation of your passwords against an updated list of compromised credentials. If a breach is discovered, Safari helps you upgrade your existing passwords. All this is done without revealing your password information to anyone \u2014 including\u00a0Apple. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Apple Pay \n \n Apple Pay is the easiest and most secure way to shop on Safari \u2014\u00a0allowing you to complete transactions with Face\u00a0ID or Touch\u00a0ID on your iPhone or iPad, with Touch\u00a0ID on your MacBook\u00a0Pro or MacBook\u00a0Air, or by double-clicking the side button on your Apple\u00a0Watch.

Different device. \n \n Safari works seamlessly and syncs your passwords, bookmarks, history, tabs, and more across Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Apple\u00a0Watch. And when your Mac, iOS, or iPadOS devices are near each other, they can automatically pass what you\u2019re doing in Safari from one device to another using Handoff. You can even copy images, video, or text from Safari on your iPhone or iPad, then paste into another app on your nearby Mac \u2014 or vice\u00a0versa. \n \n Learn more about continuity   \n \n \n \n \n Tab View \n Reading List \n iCloud Keychain \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tab View. \n When you use Safari on multiple devices, your tabs carry over from one Apple device to another. So you can search, shop, work, or browse on your iPhone, then switch to your iPad or Mac and pick up right where you left\u00a0off. \n \n Reading List. \n Save web pages you want to read later by adding them to your Reading List. Then view them on any of your iCloud-connected devices \u2014 even if you\u2019re not connected to the\u00a0internet. \n \n iCloud Keychain. \n iCloud\u00a0Keychain securely stores your user names, passwords, and credit card numbers and keeps them up to date on your trusted devices.
