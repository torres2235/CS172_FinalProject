Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press When Paul Moser considers getting a coronavirus vaccine, he also thinks about his outstanding medical debt: $1,200 from a few urology visits that he has been unable to pay off. Mr. Moser, a 52-year-old gas station cashier in New York   State, has friends who were surprised by bills for coronavirus tests, and worries the same could happen with the  vaccine . For now, he\u2019s holding off on getting his shot. \u201cWe were told by the legislators that all the testing was supposed to be free, and then surprise, it\u2019s $150,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree it\u2019s important to get vaccinated, but I don\u2019t have a sense of urgency around it.\u201d Congress passed laws barring pharmacies and hospitals from billing patients for coronavirus vaccines. Signs at vaccination sites advertise that the shot is free. From the beginning, health officials and government leaders have told the public it won\u2019t cost anything. And there have been few reports of people experiencing charges. Even so, some unvaccinated adults cite concerns about a  surprise bill  as a reason for not getting the shot. Many of them are accustomed to a health system in which the bills are frequent, large and often unexpected. A  recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll  found that about a third of unvaccinated adults were unsure whether insurance covered the new vaccine and were concerned they might need to pay for the shot. The concern was especially pronounced among Hispanic and Black survey respondents. \u201cThe conversations we have are like: \u2018Yes, I know it\u2019s good. Yes, I want it, but I don\u2019t have insurance,\u2019\u201d said Ilan Shapiro, medical director of AltaMed, a community health network in Southern California that serves a large Hispanic population. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure everyone knows it\u2019s free.\u201d The confusion may represent a lack of information, or skepticism that a bill won\u2019t follow a visit to the doctor. Liz Hamel, director of survey research at Kaiser, said it could reflect people\u2019s experience with the health system: \u201cPeople may have heard it\u2019s available for free, but not believe it.\u201d Congress has tried to protect patients from bills for coronavirus vaccines and tests. Early in the pandemic, it mandated that insurers waive co-payments and deductibles for both services, and set up a fund to reimburse doctors seeing uninsured patients. Even so, patients found themselves  facing   bills for testing  \u2014 some for over $1,000. Some doctors billed uninsured patients for tests rather than the new, federal fund. Others tacked on unexpected fees and services to the testing visit. The rules for vaccine billing were made  even stricter . To become vaccinators, doctors and pharmacies had to sign a contract promising not to bill patients for shots. The stronger protections appear to have worked. While many patients have encountered coronavirus bills for testing \u2014 The New York Times  has documented  dozens of cases in bills submitted by readers \u2014 there have been only a handful involving vaccines. Still, some unexpected charges have slipped through: Patients in  Illinois ,  North Carolina  and  Colorado  have mistakenly received vaccine bills. In all cases, vaccine providers reversed the charge and apologized for the errors. The federal government has received some complaints about unexpected charges, and recently warned doctors against billing patients. Surprise bills for coronavirus vaccines, tests and other medical care can leave an impression on patients. Americans with medical debt are more likely to skip needed care than people who hold other types of debt, like outstanding credit card bills or student loans, according to  a 2013 study  by Lucie Kalousova, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Riverside. \u201cFor someone who has incurred medical debt, they may be told by the media and everyone else that the vaccine is cost-free, but they\u2019ve also had this very negative, prior encounter with the medical system that has created feelings of mistrust,\u201d she said. Some patients who worried about the cost of a coronavirus vaccine said they always expect a bill to follow a doctor\u2019s appointment. They cited stories from friends or family members who ended up with expensive coronavirus testing and treatment bills, and wondered why the vaccine would be any different. \u201cThis is America \u2014 your health care is not free,\u201d said Elizabeth Drummond, a 42-year-old mother in Oregon who is unvaccinated. \u201cI just feel like that is how the vaccination process is going to go. They\u2019re going to try to capitalize on it.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that survey research overstates how many Americans fear getting a surprise vaccine bill. When The Times, through Kaiser\u2019s help, conducted follow-up interviews, some poll respondents who voiced this concern said it didn\u2019t actually matter much to them. Instead, they said they responded that way to express frustration with the vaccine or the wider American health system. \u201cThe cost is the smallest detail,\u201d said Cody Sirman, a 32-year-old who works in manufacturing in Texas and who has decided to go unvaccinated. He said he wouldn\u2019t mind paying for the vaccine if he trusted it \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t: \u201cI think the vaccine is a complete sham. It was just a way to see how much control the government can have over the population.\u201d Image A public bus turned mobile vaccination clinic in Foley, Minn., this month. Health officials are finding inventive ways to make getting a shot simpler, yet it\u2019s clear that some reluctance is a result of other factors. Credit... Liam James Doyle for The New York Times For many, the potential cost of a vaccine is only part of a constellation of reasons for remaining unvaccinated. It can often be hard for pollsters to know \u2014 or even patients to identify \u2014 the decisive factor. Separate research from the Census Bureau last month found that Americans were more worried about vaccine side effects than about potential charges. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t saying they\u2019re just concerned about one thing; it\u2019s usually a lot of things,\u201d said Ms. Hamel of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Tiffany Addotey, a 42-year-old school bus driver in North Carolina, does cite a concern about cost. That stems mostly from her experience trying to get a coronavirus test. \u201cIt concerns me that some places were charging like $200 for coronavirus tests,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay. I went home. I have enough bills as it is.\u201d There are other things that concern her, like the safety of the vaccine given its fast development, as well as the recent Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause. When Ms. Addotey was informed that federal law makes the vaccine free for all Americans, she responded, \u201cSo I\u2019ll just have to pay my co-pay?\u201d Learning that it really would be free, with no co-payment, \u201chelped a little bit,\u201d she said. But it wasn\u2019t enough to put her mind at ease about getting vaccinated, at least not yet. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and wait for it to be on the market a little longer,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I will get it, after a little more research and a little more time.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Site Index Site Information Navigation \u00a9\u00a0 2021 \u00a0 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Accessibility Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
