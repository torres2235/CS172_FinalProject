Newsom\u2019s 2021-22 revised budget\t\t \n \n The University of California is deeply grateful to Gov. Newsom for proposing the largest state investment in UC\u2019s history: more than $807 million, which includes more than $506 million in ongoing funding for core campus operations, student needs and medical training. The budget, with the support of legislative leadership, reflects an earlier agreement to fully restore more than $300 million in budget reductions that were enacted in the 2020 state budget. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n @UofCalifornia \n \n \n . @ucriverside  historian Jorge Leal has taken a furtive step into documenting the Latinx community\u2019s emerging L.A. f\u2026  https://t.co/3GVXgmYXtB   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Priorities Spotlight Double the Pell \n Defending DACA recipients \n Civic Engagement \n Climate Lab \n Fig. 1 \n FirstGen \n Innovation and Entrepreneurship \n Student Opportunity \n Transfer Students \n \n Systemwide Programs UC-HBCU Initiative Programs \n President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program \n \n Presidential Initiatives Carbon Neutrality Initiative \n Global Food Initiative \n Smoke and Tobacco-Free Student Fellowships \n UC-Mexico Initiative \n UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement \n Undocumented Students Initiative \n \n \n UC System Overview \n Parts of UC \n Stewardship \n Working at UC \n Leadership Academic Senate \n Board of Regents \n \n Information Center \n \n Support UC Advocate About the UC Advocacy Network \n UCAN Student Ambassadors \n Federal Budget \n State Budget \n Research Funding \n Enrollment \n Education \n Campus Housing \n Health Care \n Student & Faculty Diversity \n \n Donate \n Connect Alumni Career Network \n \n \n More \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Become a UC Advocate \n \n Receive email alerts about issues that are important to UC and contact your legislators to ensure the university remains a hub of opportunity, excellence, and innovation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Admissions \n Jobs \n Contact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Facebook \n Twitter \n Tumblr \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You are here UC System Infocenter UC employees, full-time equivalent (FTE)   \n UC employees, full-time equivalent (FTE) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n Reference\u00a0for faculty series and class title outlines in each group. \n 1.
