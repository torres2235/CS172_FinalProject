It is a collaborative research center launched jointly by Indiana University and the University of Illinois, along with HathiTrust, to help meet the technical challenges researchers face when dealing with massive amounts of digital text. It develops cutting-edge software tools and cyberinfrastructure to enable advanced computational access to the growing digital record of human knowledge.  Leveraging data storage and computational infrastructure at Indiana University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the HTRC builds tools and services for scholars to perform research using data from the HathiTrust Digital Library. The Center is breaking new ground in the areas of text mining and non-consumptive research, allowing scholars to fully utilize HathiTrust content while preventing intellectual property misuse within the confines of current U.S. copyright law. HTRC tools and services HTRC has developed a suite of tools and services for text data mining including web-based algorithms, freely-accessible datasets, and secure computing capsules. Access them from  HTRC Analytics .
