UC Riverside is a proud partner of Dryad and offers Dryad as a free service for all UC Riverside researchers to publish and archive their data. It is designed to be a simple tool for researchers to archive and share their datasets, while fulfilling funder requirements. Datasets published in Dryad receive a citation and can be versioned at any time.\u00a0 All records created in Dryad are searchable; indexed in Data Citation Index (SM), Scopus, and Google Dataset Search; and provided a unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI).\u00a0 Dryad may be used as a permanent archive with stable URLs. \n Dryad provides \n \n Curation services for submitted datasets \n A persistent DOI for permanent citation and discovery \n Ability to make private or embargo datasets \n Discovery and retrieval of data through faceted search and browse \n \n \n \n Dryad Submission and Publication Process \n \n \n \n Dryad's Quickstart Guide to Data Sharing \n \n \n \n Dryad's Good Data Practices \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dryad FAQs\n                                 \n \n \n \n FAQs \n Who can deposit data here? \n Any UCR affiliated researcher (faculty, postdoc, student, or staff) can use this resource to archive and share research data sets, provided they have appropriate permission. Data that are collected at research sites are under the stewardship of the Principal Investigator (PI) named on the resource provided to collect the data, and this PI may grant permission to deposit data. \n How can I start using Dryad? \n Dryad uses ORCID as its primary login method. Log into ORCID using your institutional account. This will redirect you to login through CAS using your NetID and password. \n What if I have a better repository?\u00a0 Do I need to use Dryad? \n No.\u00a0 We recommend using the most appropriate repository to share your data.\u00a0 However, data may be uploaded in both places and cross-listed.\u00a0 Using Dryad will ensure long-term storage with a persistent DOI. \n What if I have a Data Dictionary or Code Book? \n Data can't be used by others if they don't understand what the data describes.\u00a0 A code book which describes the data may included with the upload. \n What if I have collaborators outside of UCR? \n You will need UCR credentials to log into the system and deposit data. You can, however, add your collaborators to the \u201cdata contributors\u201d section of the metadata. Although only researchers logged in with UCR credentials can deposit data, anyone can search, view and download datasets in Dryad. \n Do you support data embargoes or restricted access? \n Dryad supports limited time embargoes, while providing a DOI for stable citation and retrieval of the data. \n Who can access these datasets? \n All data deposited into Dryad is CC0. This means anyone can access and download the datasets.\u00a0 Although many researchers would prefer to maintain more control over who downloads and uses their data, we believe that having data that are fully open is the best way to enable academic advancement. Read  Panton Principles for Open Data in Science  for more information. \n How will someone find my data? \n Metadata will be indexed by the Data Citation Index SM , Scopus, and Google Dataset Search. \n Do the data have to be associated with a publication? \n No. Dryad accepts all data, regardless of whether it\u2019s been used to publish a paper. \n Do I need to log into Dryad to get data? \n Persons requesting data are not required to sign-in in order to do so. Unless an embargo period is selected, data sets will be made available immediately. \n What if I have other questions about Dryad? \n Please  contact us   with any questions about Dryad. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   <<  Previous:  General Repositories and Government Data Next:  Working With Data >> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Last Updated:   Apr 21, 2021 10:01 AM   \n \n URL:   https://guides.lib.ucr.edu/datamanagement   \n \n  Print Page   \n \n \n Login to LibApps   \n \n \n \n \n \n Subjects:  \n General and Multidisciplinary Research \n \n \n Tags:  \n Data ,  Data management ,  reproducible research \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
