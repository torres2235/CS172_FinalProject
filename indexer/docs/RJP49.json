For updates on the campus closure visit:  https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus . \n However, we want to let you know that USP is here for you, and to help meet your needs. But in accordance with the new orders, our physical office, along with the rest of the campus is closed. However,  USP services remain open and accessible via online/virtual work.  Please see below on how to access our services. \n How Can I Contact USP For Help? \n If you need assistance you are strongly encouraged to make a virtual appointment (ZOOM/Phone). Please schedule your appointment via  ana-usp-ucr.youcanbook.me . For any questions, please contact  Ana.Coria@ucr.edu .  \n Sincerely, \n Ana Coria \nCoordinator, Undocumented Student Programs \nUC Riverside \n \n \n \n Here for You, Always \n Student Affairs is here to support you throughout the campus closure. \n Connect \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n DACA Assistance \n UC Immigrant Legal Services provides free DACA renewal assistance\u00a0to\u00a0UC students and their immediate family members.\u00a0You should assess whether it makes sense for you to apply as soon as possible. There is no application deadline, but the U.S. government publicized that it will appeal the DACA court decision. The renewal program may be available indefinitely or it could be terminated, depending on how the case proceeds in the courts. \n To schedule an appointment with UC Immigrant Legal Service Center, contact\u00a0 ana.coria@ucr.edu \u00a0via your UCR email.\u00a0 Learn more \u00a0about immigration legal services. \n \u00a0 \n Additional Resources \n UCILS's DACA Injunction\u00a0FAQ \n ILRC's DACA Rescission\u00a0Case Summary\u00a0 \n UCILSC's FAQ on TPS \n UCILSC's FAQ on Real ID \n ILRC's Legislation Summary \n NILC's About DACA and Employment\u00a0 \n UC Immigrant Legal Services Center's Message on DACA (9/5/17) \n IRLC DACA Advisory\u00a0 \n \"Know Your Rights\" Card for UC student \n UCR: FAQ for UCR Employees on Immigration Enforcement \u00a0 (Pick up printed copies from the USP office.) \n FAQ for UC Employees on Immigration Enforcement \n DACA does\u00a0 not impact \u00a0an undergraduate student\u2019s eligibility for state/institutional financial aid. \n Undocumented students who meet the \u00a0 AB 540 \u00a0requirements are eligible for state and institutional aid through the\u00a0 CA DREAM Act . CA DREAM Act allows undocumented students who are eligible for \u00a0 AB540 \u00a0to receive aid such as Cal Grants, the DREAM Loan, and UCR grants and scholarships. \n To summarize, eligibility to state and institutional\u00a0financial aid is\u00a0 not \u00a0based off a student\u2019s DACA status. \n \u00a0 \n Statements from UC and UCR Leadership \n UC President Napolitano calls on Congress to Make Protections Permanent \n Kim A.
