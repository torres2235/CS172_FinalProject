Where data or collections of data are published it is critical that they be published with a clear and explicit statement of the wishes and expectations of the publishers with respect to re-use and re-purposing of individual data elements, the whole data collection, and subsets of the collection. This statement should be precise, irrevocable, and based on an appropriate and recognized legal statement in the form of a waiver or license. \n   *When publishing data make an explicit and robust statement of your wishes.* \n 2. Many widely recognized licenses are not intended for, and are not appropriate for, data or collections of data. A variety of waivers and licenses that are designed for and appropriate for the treatment of data are described [here](http://opendefinition.org/licenses#Data). Creative Commons licenses (apart from CCZero), GFDL, GPL, BSD, etc are NOT appropriate for data and their use is STRONGLY discouraged. \n   *Use a recognized waiver or license that is appropriate for data.* \n 3. \u00c2\u00a0The use of licenses which limit commercial re-use or limit the production of derivative works by excluding use for particular purposes or by specific persons or organizations is STRONGLY discouraged. These licenses make it impossible to effectively integrate and re-purpose datasets and prevent commercial activities that could be used to support data preservation. \n   *If you want your data to be effectively used and added to by others it should be open as defined by the  Open Knowledge/Data Definition  \u2013 in particular non-commercial and other restrictive clauses should not be used.* \n 4. Furthermore, in science it is STRONGLY recommended that data, especially where publicly funded, be explicitly placed in the public domain via the use of the Public Domain Dedication and Licence or Creative Commons Zero Waiver. This is in keeping with the public funding of much scientific research and the general ethos of sharing and re-use within the scientific community. \n   *Explicit dedication of data underlying published science into the public domain via PDDL or CCZero is strongly recommended and ensures compliance with both the Science Commons  Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data  and the  Open Knowledge/Data Definition .* \n \n Endorse the Principles \u00bb \n \n #### Authored by: \n \n Peter Murray-Rust ,  University of Cambridge  (UK) \n Cameron Neylon ,  STFC  (UK) \n Rufus Pollock ,  Open Knowledge Foundation  and  University of Cambridge  (UK) \n John Wilbanks ,  Science Commons  (USA) \n With the help of the members of the Open Knowledge Foundation  Working Group on Open Data in Science \n \u00a0 \n To cite the Panton Principles, please use the following details in the relevant citation style for your publication: \n \n Panton Principles, Principles for open data in science.
