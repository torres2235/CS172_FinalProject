Here's an overview of how Twitter Ads work, why you see certain ads, your privacy settings, and other options. \n \n \n \n \n What are Twitter Ads? \n You may see different kinds of ads on Twitter, including\u00c2\u00a0 Promoted Ads ,  Follower Ads , and  Trend Takeover . We may show these ads to you when you are logged in or logged out of Twitter. They are clearly marked with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPromoted\u00e2\u0080\u009d icon. You can interact with most promoted content in much the same way as organic content. If you follow, like, or Retweet content on Twitter, including promoted content, your followers may see your name associated with that content. \n \n \n \n \n \n Why you see certain Twitter Ads \n Your activity on Twitter, the information you provide to Twitter, and our relationships with ad partners all help make promoted content more relevant for you. \n \n When you use Twitter to follow, Tweet, search, view, or interact with Tweets or Twitter accounts, we may use these actions to customize Twitter Ads for you. For example, if you search for a specific term, we may show you promoted content related to that topic. We also might customize ads using other information about you, such as your profile information; your mobile device location (if  location features  are turned on); your IP address; or the apps installed on your device. This helps us show you local ads and other ads that you might prefer. \n Twitter may also personalize ads based on information that Twitter and our affiliates collect and that our ad partners share with us, such as a hashed email address, a mobile device identifier, or browser-related information (a browser cookie ID). \n This helps Twitter display ads about things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already shown interest in from brands and businesses that you may like. For example, you could receive a Promoted Ad about a deal or promotion from a business whose website you frequent, or email newsletter you subscribe to. You could also see this business as a Follower Ad in one of your \"Who to Follow\" suggestions. Learn more about your \u00c2\u00a0privacy controls for personalized ads . \n \n \n \n \n \n Managing your privacy settings \n We're committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices. \n \n If you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads on and off of Twitter, there are several ways to turn off this feature: \n \n Using your Twitter settings, visit the \"Personalization and data settings\"\u00c2\u00a0and adjust the \"Personalize ads\" setting. \n \n If you're on web, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer choice tool at  optout.aboutads.info  to opt-out of seeing interest-based advertising from Twitter in your current browser. \n \n On iOS 13 and earlier only, if\u00c2\u00a0you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for iOS on your current mobile device, enable the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLimit Ad Tracking\u00e2\u0080\u009d setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions).\u00c2\u00a0 \n \n On Android, if you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for Android on your current mobile device, enable \u00e2\u0080\u009cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d in your Android phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settings (precise directions and name of the setting may be different on different Android versions and OEM Android variants). \n \n \n \n \n Note: Please confirm that you're logged in if you want to view or change the web settings for your Twitter account. Changing your Twitter settings in your web browser when you are logged out will only affect behavior on that browser while you're not logged in to Twitter. Learn more about how to access your  personalization and data settings , including in your Twitter mobile app. \n \n Twitter also works with third-party advertising partners, including Google, to market Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own services and serve ads on behalf of Twitter advertisers, including through the delivery of interest-based ads. The privacy options described here apply to interest-based ads served by or on Twitter; they do not apply to ads served by these other companies off of Twitter, including on Twitter's behalf. You can learn more about opting out of receiving interest-based ads from other companies at  optout.aboutads.info  and  www.networkadvertising.org/choices .\u00c2\u00a0If you're on the web, you can also opt-out of Google Analytics by installing Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  opt-out browser add-on , and opt-out of interest-based Google ads using  Google Ads settings . \n \n On iOS version 14 and later only, if you do not want Twitter to access your iOS Identifier for Advertising, disable the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAllow Apps to Request to Track\u00e2\u0080\u009d setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions). \n \n In addition, whether you're logged in or logged out, you always have the option to \"dismiss\" Promoted Ads and/or accounts that you're not interested in seeing. This feedback helps us show you better promoted content. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How can I run Twitter Ads? \n Eligible accounts \u00c2\u00a0can launch campaigns at\u00c2\u00a0 ads.twitter.com .\u00c2\u00a0For more information, visit\u00c2\u00a0 getting started with Twitter Ads campaigns   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          Ready to get started?\n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Create your ad\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              Twitter platform\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  Twitter.com\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Status\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Card validator\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Privacy Center\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Transparency Center\n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n              Twitter, Inc.\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  About the company\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Twitter for Good\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Company news\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Brand toolkit\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Jobs and internships\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Investors\n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n              Help\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  Help Center\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Using Twitter\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Twitter Media\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Ads Help Center\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Managing your account\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Safety and security\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Rules and policies\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Contact us\n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n              Developer resources\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  Developer home\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Documentation\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Forums\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Communities\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Developer blog\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Engineering blog\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Developer terms\n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n              Business resources\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  Advertise\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Twitter for business\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Resources and guides\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Twitter for marketers\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Marketing insights\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Brand inspiration\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Twitter Data\n                 \n \n \n \n                  Twitter Flight School\n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \u00a9 2021 Twitter, Inc.\n             \n \n \n \n                Cookies\n               \n \n \n \n                Privacy\n               \n \n \n \n                Terms and conditions\n               \n \n \n \n \n    English\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Business \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              Deutsch\n             \n \n \n \n              English\n             \n \n \n \n              Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol\n             \n \n \n \n              Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais\n             \n \n \n \n              Portugu\u00c3\u00aas\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa\u009e\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u0084\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u008a\u00d8\u00a9\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            By using Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services you agree to our  Cookies Use .
