David has fought to protect underdogs his whole life, including spearheading a bill to help secure funding for Cal Grant recipients. Switching from outside BCOE, he choose bioengineering to find ways to assist people with tangible technologies in addition to policy changes. David served as the Operations Lead for BioHack, re-evaluating its budget and programming in a way that helped future hackathons succeed in a rem ... ote environment, and rekindled UCR's chess culture by assembling a Chess Club e-sports team that made it to the national playoffs. Before pursuing a master's in bioengineering, David will compete in the Deep Space Food Challenge to design nutritional technologies for future astronauts. In his graduation speech, he explores the meaning of \"living the promise.\"  # BCOEGrad2021   # UCRGrad2021   # UC2021Grad   See More It looks like you may be having problems playing this video.
