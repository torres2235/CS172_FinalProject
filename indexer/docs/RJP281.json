UC enacted a Policy on Safeguards, Security and Emergency Management in January 2006 that contemplates the need for chancellors to take extraordinary measures in the event of \u201ca natural or man-made disaster, a civil disorder which poses a threat of serious injury to persons or damage to property,\u201d or other \u201cseriously disruptive events.\u201d8 Pursuant to this policy, UC may take appropriate steps to protect the health and safety of its students in the face of a known serious health crisis like a serious outbreak or pandemic. \n \n \n \n \n            How is UCR disinfecting surfaces?     \n \n UCR is taking extensive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Examples include: \n - Deployed hand sanitizers in university-owned housing, dining areas, and entrances to buildings; \n - Began using a new CDC-approved chemical disinfectant, after review and approval by Environmental Health and Safety, across the campus; \n - Increased cleaning in university-owned housing of high-touch areas including lobbies, lounges, restrooms, and elevators; and\u00a0 \n - Increased cleaning in campus General Assignment classrooms and adjacent restrooms. \n \n \n \n \n            What should I do if I am planning an event?     \n \n All in-person, non-essential gatherings on campus are suspended, until further notice \n \n \n \n \n            Is there a duty to report COVID-19 cases to state or local health authorities?     \n \n Yes. Generally, health care providers \u2014 including doctors, nurses, physician assistants, among others \u2014 who know of, or are in attendance on, a case or suspected case of COVID-19 are required to report it to the local health department immediately, by telephone, in accordance with internal administrative procedures. Where no health care provider is in attendance, any individual who knows of, or suspects that,\u00a0someone has COVID-19 is permitted to report it to the local health department. Local health departments, in turn, notify the CDPH. \n Contact information for the local health officers may be found at the  CDPH website . \n \n \n \n \n            Guidance for all Transportation-related activities including parking, permits, biking, buses, and campus transportation issues     \n \n Please refer to the  UCR Transportation FAQ  for answers on questions such as: \n Parking on Campus during Shutdown including Visitor Parking \n Parking Permits, Refunds, and Citations \n Renting and maintaining Fleet vehicles \n Buses, Biking, and Carpool/Vanpool \n Parking for Student Employment \n And many more! \n \n \n \n \n \n            Which campus buildings are being serviced by custodial staff?     \n \n Student Health Services, the UC Intellicenter, the UCPD building, and housing and dining facilities are receiving regular custodial services. Many academic buildings on campus are receiving limited cleaning services. For a full list, visit  https://facilities.ucr.edu/ \n \n \n \n \n            How is maintenance support, landscape services, trash pickup, and recycling impacted by the campus closure?      \n \n Maintenance staff will be on site Monday-Friday from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and will be available for emergencies and to monitor building conditions. Landscape Services will manage only emergency, weather-related situations. Exterior trash containers and dumpsters will be emptied weekly; housing and dining trash will be serviced as needed. Recycling will not be supported during the COVID-19 closure. For more information, including emergency contact information, visit  https://facilities.ucr.edu/ .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            Are there steps that leaders, managers, and supervisors can take to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19?     \n \n The Riverside County Public Health order requires UC Riverside to minimize the number of people on campus while maintaining the critical functions of the university.\u00a0The campus closure is intended to remove UCR employees from the physical campus through April 3 unless they are identified as essential personnel who perform critical functions that can only be conducted on-site. All others will either remote work or, if their jobs cannot be done remotely, are eligible for 14 days of administrative leave, as indicated in yesterday\u2019s message.\u00a0\u00a0 \n For essential personnel supporting critical campus functions on campus, the\u00a0 CDC \u00a0recommends social distancing measures, which include but are not limited to: \n Supervisors implementing flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to minimize person-to-person contact. \n Maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible. \n Employees wishing to\u00a0 briefly \u00a0return to campus to retrieve materials needed to work remotely must contact their department head/chair for approval in advance. They should also contact their supervisor to secure access to their office if needed. \n If this approach is not feasible for some reason, supervisors may contact the Central Plant at 951\u2011827\u20114677 between the hours of 7:00 a.m. \u2013 2:00 p.m. to provide access to offices/labs for personnel to retrieve personal items. After March 17 or after-hours, UCR Police may be contacted at 951\u2011827\u20115222 for service. \n \n \n \n \n            What steps should be taken if an employee becomes ill with fever, cough or other concerning symptoms?     \n \n Review the  When Do You Return To Campus guidance \u00a0document. \n Anyone sick and believed to be at risk for COVID-19 infection should be advised to seek medical assistance and follow the CDC recommendations: \n Stay home except to get medical care. \n Separate yourself from other people in your home and avoid sharing personal household items. \n If you have a medical appointment, call the health care provider and tell them that you are concerned about the possibility of COVID-19 infection before going to the doctor\u2019s office. \n Wear a facemask when you are around other people. \n Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue. \n Clean your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. \n Avoid sharing personal household items. \n Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening. \n If you are placed under active monitoring, or facilitated self-monitoring, follow the instructions provided by your local health department or occupational health professional, as appropriate. \n Consult with your health care provider before discontinuing home isolation. \n \n \n \n \n \n            Should an instructor require a student who is out sick to provide a health care provider\u2019s note?     \n \n Verification of student illness is at the discretion of each instructor. Instructors should use a consistent practice to avoid bias and discrimination in their approach. Students who are uncomfortable providing health information to instructors may work through Student Affairs Case Management. \n\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n            May UCR prohibit an employee from coming to work if the employee is known to have contracted COVID-19 themselves, or to have had close contact with someone who has?     \n \n Yes. UC is obligated to provide a safe workplace and may take necessary and reasonable steps to minimize health risks for its employees, such as requiring that employees not come to work if they have COVID-19. \n If any employment actions are taken as a result of COVID-19, such as requiring that employees not come to work, such actions must be consistent with federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace. \n Review the  When Do You Return To Campus guidance \u00a0document. \n \n \n \n \n            What additional steps should be taken if an employee is suspected to be ill with COVID-19 at work?     \n \n Managers and supervisors should encourage employees to take leave and seek medical assistance from their primary care physician. \n If an employee declines to take leave, managers and supervisors should consult their local human resources (HRBP) or academic personnel offices for assistance in determining whether there is objective evidence of a suspected case of COVID-19. If possible, managers and supervisors should ask on-site employee health services, if available, to assist in making this determination. If there is objective evidence that an employee has acute respiratory illness and that employee refuses to take leave, a manager or supervisor may, over the objection of the employee, require that the employee leave the workplace. In such circumstances, the absence should be recorded as \u201capproved.\u201d Managers and supervisors should seek assistance from their local human resources (HRBP) or academic personnel offices before taking any action, to ensure that all appropriate options have been considered. Action should not be taken based solely on a manager\u2019s or supervisor\u2019s subjective assessment of an employee\u2019s medical condition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quick Links \n \n \n Campus Return \n \n Hotline \n \n UCR Daily Wellness Check Survey \n \n Human Resources COVID-19 Resources \n \n Student Health Services \n \n Campus Emergency Status \n \n Keep Teaching \n \n Keep Learning \n \n Keep Working \n \n Keep Researching \n \n Coronavirus Resources \n \n Face Covering Request \n \n Research Ramp Up \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Contact Us \n ehsPublicHealth@ucr.edu \n Report a Concern \n \n \n \n Request \n Disinfectant Kit \n Face Covering \n \n \n \n Resources \n Campus Return \n Research \u00a0 \n Telecommute \u00a0 \n Travel \n \n \n \n Health \n Daily Wellness Check \u00a0survey \n Symptom monitoring and reporting procedures  (SOP) \n Testing ( on-campus  |\u00a0 off-campus ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n               Environmental Health & Safety \n             900 University Ave.              Riverside, CA 92521              \n  tel: (951) 827-5528                  fax: (951) 827-5122          email:  ehs@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n Coronavirus Resources & Updates \n \n Customer Service Satisfaction Survey for EH&S \n \n Emergency Management \n \n Fire & Life Safety \n \n Risk & Safety Solutions Web Application Log In \n \n Risk Management \n \n UC Police Department \n \n UC Risk & Safety Training \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
