The Music Library will close its doors at 6 p.m. on Friday, September 6, 2019. \n Note that due to the move, music scores, audio CDs and LPs will be unavailable to the public during the week of Sept. 9 - 13. \n The integration of the Music Library into the Rivera Library comes as a response to the request from the Music Department and the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) who have long needed more space for their expanding academic programs.\u00a0 \n While the library is sad to be leaving the Music Library space, this move finally brings together all the physical music library content (books, journals, scores and audio) into the same building, as the Music Library only held the scores and audio. The scores and audio will now be available to faculty and students for over 50 more hours per week during the academic quarters, as the Music Library had limited hours of operation. \n Library staff carefully\u00a0determined the new locations of the collections involved, taking extensive measurements, evaluating the space available, and deciding on the best locations for optimal accessibility. \n Where to find Music Library materials, starting on Sept. 16: \n Music books, journals, and scores \n \n Music Library M, ML and MT call number materials will be moved and shelved after the new location of the L call numbers in Rivera Library, second floor (unit one). \n Music Study Scores will be shelved separately, following the MT call numbers. \n \n Music media (CD, VHS, LP, etc.) \n \n Music audio (CDs and\u00a0LPs) will be interfiled in security cases along with the current Media Collection on the first floor of Rivera Library. \n \n Listening equipment \n \n The record and cassette players will be set up\u00a0along the southwest wall on the first floor of Rivera Library (past the print stations). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sign up for UCR Library News \n Click here to sign up today! \n \n \n Past Newsletters \n Click here to view the newsletter archive \n \n \n Share \n \n \n \n Contact \n \n Ann Frenkel \n Deputy University Librarian, Research and Instructional Services \n (951) 827-4824 \n Email \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n \n \n Hours \n Directory Departments & Services \n Staff \n \n News \n Publications Newsletters \n Strategic Plan \n \n Exhibits \n Workshops & Events \n FAQs \n Policies \n Jobs \n Directions, Parking, Mailing Address \n Giving to the Library \n Service Notifications \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Libraries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tom\u00e1s Rivera Library   \n \n            (951) 827-3220           \n \n \n \n Orbach Science Library   \n \n            (951) 827-3701           \n \n \n \n Special Collections & University Archives   \n \n            (951) 827-3233           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quick Links \n \n Student Disability Resource Center \n Directions & Parking \n Campus Safety Escort Services \n Jobs \n Privacy Policy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Follow \n \n Twitter \n Facebook \n YouTube \n Instagram \n Give to the Library \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a9 2020\u00a0Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Using the Library Borrow, Renew, Return Borrowing & Renewing \n Returning \n Borrowing Course Reserves \n Electronic Document Delivery \n Paging Service \n Fines & Fees \n Appeal Your Bills \n \n Getting a Library Card \n Borrowing Privileges \n Technology & Equipment Print, Copy, Scan \n Equipment \n Software on Public Computers \n Wireless Access \n Connect from Off-Campus \n \n Study Spaces \n Interlibrary Loan How to Use My ILL Requests \n Institutional Lending \n \n Disability Services \n Resources for Remote Users \n \n Research Support Getting Started Learn About Research Fundamentals \n How Do I Find?
