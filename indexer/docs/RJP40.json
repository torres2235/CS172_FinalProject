Additional information will be provided through case investigation to individuals who have had  exposure  until the time the patient is isolated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Reference \n Source: UCR Health, Campus testing lab, or Office of Emergency Management | Data updated: Mon-Fri \n Source: Student Health Services | Data updated: weekly (testing occurs Mon-Thu) \n Source:\u00a0 Riverside University Health System \u00a0 \n *Previously tested positive, counted only once in overall case count \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Employee exposure \n Assembly Bill 685 \u00a0requires employers to notify all employees who were at a worksite of all potential exposures to COVID-19 and notify the local public health agency of outbreaks. For anyone who has been potentially exposed as a close contact (a close contact is someone you were within 6 feet of for at least 15 minutes within a 24 hour period), they will be contacted directly by the University's case investigation team and provided appropriate instructions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Vaccination \n Strategy \n The University falls under  California's vaccination plan , and is strictly adhering to the California Department of Public Health's prioritization protocol. We anticipate that most of our employees and students will be vaccinated by their healthcare providers. For more information regarding eligibility, process, and for latest updates refer to the campus  COVID-19 vaccines  webpage. \n Policy \n SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program \n The purpose of this policy is to protect the health and safety of the University\u2019s patients and the faculty, staff, students, and others who work or train in the University\u2019s locations \u2013 including all of the University\u2019s academic medical centers, student health and counseling centers, and other facilities and clinics. The policy requires all University of California personnel and trainees working on-site in these locations to participate in education about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that will be available and either consent to administration of the vaccine or affirmatively opt out of SARS CoV-2 vaccination. For more information about what to expect after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, refer to the  Fact Sheet: Moderna  (Dec 2020) or  Fact Sheet: Pfizer-BioNTech  (Dec 2020). Review the Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Proposed Vaccination Policy for  Faculty/Staff/Employees  and  Students . \n Proposed POLICY \n Vaccine Registration \n To assist the campus with tracking our community's vaccination, please complete the form below: \n \u00a0COVID-19 Vaccine Tracking Form \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Definitions \n EXPOSURE: \u00a0Contact with an individual for greater than 15 minutes, less than 6 feet apart, and one or both individuals was not wearing a face covering / mask with the COVID-19 positive individual(s) within two days of symptom onset or for individuals without symptoms, 2 days prior to positive specimen collection (as explained by the Riverside Department of Public Health). \n HIGHLY INFECTIOUS : period begins two days before they were last on campus, and ends the day they were last on campus. \n POSITIVE: \u00a0\u00a0Individual was on\u00a0campus within 2 days of symptom onset or receiving a positive test and/or individuals with direct on-campus impact who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are currently self-isolating. \n POSITIVE CASE:\u00a0 Individual who reported a positive test to campus. NOTE:\u00a0This\u00a0may not necessarily indicate the date of a COVID-19 test. \n POSITIVITY RATE : Percentage of students who tested positive out of total tested on campus. Staff and faculty are not included because they are generally tested by their medical provider and/or county testing sites. Student surveillance test data is\u00a0provided by ITS. \n ISOLATION: \u00a0Separation of an individual who is positive for COVID-19 from others who are not sick. \n QUARANTINE: \u00a0Separation of an individual who is known to be exposed to COVID-19 from others who are not known to be exposed. For more information refer to\u00a0 CDC explanations . \n Version history \n The data on this webpage has been updated or impacted as follows: \n 09/10/20 Numbers were updated to match official reports via the Daily Wellness Check survey \n 10/02/20 Weekly case counts were corrected to match date reported to the University\u00a0 \n 10/05/20 Student positivity rate added, based on-campus testing lab \n 10/12/20 Weekly case counts were corrected to match data from on-campus testing lab\u00a0 \n 10/19/20 County cases added\u00a0 \n 01/20/21 High-exposure period dates added \n 01/26/21 Cases resorted by date reported (vs. date tested) \n 04/21/21 Corrected highly infectious\u00a0dates to reflect definition \n About the data \n These figures are based on cases reported to the University via the: 1)\u00a0Daily Wellness Check survey, 2) on-campus testing lab, and/or 3) Office of Emergency Management (OEM). As it is possible that not all cases are reported to the University, the information above may not include all cases among the campus community. For more information, refer to the COVID-19\u00a0 Symptom monitoring and reporting procedures  for covered employees and supervisors.. \n Community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 continues locally, in our region and in the United States. Wearing masks when around others, practicing physical distancing and  other precautions  are vital to slowing this outbreak. Visit the California Department of Public Health  Coronavirus website  to view information and statistics by county and statewide.        \n Report a COVID-19\u00a0Positive Case Wellness Hotline \n Campus is partially open Campus status \n Positive case? \n \u00a0 \n How to report a positive case \n Employees who test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed are asked to report this information to campus by: 1) Call\u00a0 Wellness Hotline \u00a0(844) 827-6827 or, 2) Complete the\u00a0 Daily Wellness Check \u00a0survey. This will also initiate follow-up from Human Resources, case investigation, and other campus support departments. Supervisors also may use this number to report an employee who has a confirmed positive test. Supervisors should submit a report only if: 1) employees are unable to self report, or 2) there is uncertainty that employees reported themselves. Supervisor reports can be made by providing employee\u2019s contact information (name, personal phone, and email) via email to\u00a0 COVID19@medsch.ucr.edu . \n Case investigation \n Case Investigation is critical to helping stop potential spread of COVID-19 and to help protect the health of vulnerable people in our community (refer to the\u00a0 CDC guidance \u00a0for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19).\u00a0 \n Employees.\u00a0 A\u00a0case investigators will notify employees who suspected have come in close contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 once notified via the hotline or survey.\u00a0 \n UCR will not release the name of the person and requires that the entire community support efforts to protect other's\u00a0privacy. Further, during the case investigation process, it is very important that individuals are truthful and thorough about where they have been and who they were around to help stop the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0 \n A healthy campus is in our hands \n Take responsibility for your health and protecting others \n Wear a face covering \n Follow physical distance guidelines and keep at least six feet between you and other individuals not in your immediate family.\u00a0 \n Wash your hands frequently for 20 seconds with soap and warm water. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.\u00a0 \n Avoid large gatherings. \n Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. \n Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw the tissue away \n If you feel sick: \n Self-isolate \n Notify your supervisor \n Contact your healthcare provider \n Complete the\u00a0 Daily Wellness Check \u00a0survey prior to coming to campus, or if changes occur (e.g., you begin you feel sick, receive positive test result, or are notified that you came in close contact with an individual who has COVID-19). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Contact Us \n ehsPublicHealth@ucr.edu \n Report a Concern \n \n \n \n Request \n Disinfectant Kit \n Face Covering \n \n \n \n Resources \n Campus Return \n Research \u00a0 \n Telecommute \u00a0 \n Travel \n \n \n \n Health \n Daily Wellness Check \u00a0survey \n Symptom monitoring and reporting procedures  (SOP) \n Testing ( on-campus  |\u00a0 off-campus ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n               Environmental Health & Safety \n             900 University Ave.              Riverside, CA 92521              \n  tel: (951) 827-5528                  fax: (951) 827-5122          email:  ehs@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n Coronavirus Resources & Updates \n \n Customer Service Satisfaction Survey for EH&S \n \n Emergency Management \n \n Fire & Life Safety \n \n Risk & Safety Solutions Web Application Log In \n \n Risk Management \n \n UC Police Department \n \n UC Risk & Safety Training \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
