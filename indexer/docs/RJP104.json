Face coverings should not have exhalation valves or vents, which allow virus particles to escape, and should not be intended for respiratory protection. For healthcare workers or employees requiring respiratory protection, visit  EH&S Respiratory Protection Program .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n To adhere to state, local, and UC requirements, face coverings requirements are outlined\u00a0in the Return to Campus Guide (COVID Prevention Plan) located at\u00a0 campusreturn.ucr.edu \u00a0(updated April 2021). \n Per UC guidance and CalOSHA, you are required to wear face coverings over the nose and mouth at all times while at work, indoors and outdoors, with the following exceptions: \n When performing duties outdoors and are alone when others are not nearby or within a 6-feet radius \u2013 face covering must be accessible and used if individual if others are within 6 feet of other individuals not living in the same household \n When working alone in a room. \n While eating or drinking at the workplace, provided employees are at least six feet apart and outside air supply to the area; if indoors, has been maximized to the extent possible. \n Participants of the UCR Respiratory Protection Program \n Individuals who cannot wear face coverings due to a medical or mental health condition or disability or deaf and hard of hearing or \n\tcommunicating with a hearing-impaired person.\n\t If accommodations are required, please contact the UCR Disability Management Office. \n Individuals exempted from wearing face coverings due to medical condition, mental health condition, or disability shall wear an effective non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape on the bottom if their condition or disability permits it. \n \n Specific tasks that cannot feasibly be performed with a face covering.\u00a0 \n Any employee not wearing a face covering must remain six feet apart from all other persons unless tested at least twice per week for COVID-19. Testing is not an alternative to face coverings when face coverings are otherwise required. \n In order to assist the UCR community to adhere to the face covering requirements, EH&S is providing face coverings for UCR personnel. Individuals should review the options and availability for face coverings below and submit a request for the appropriate number.\u00a0 Individuals can choose any combination of face coverings. \u00a0 A maximum of one of each type per person will be provided. \n Example 1:  Acceptable \u00a0 \n Number of personnel \n 5 \n Bandana 1 \n \u00a0 \n Bandana 2 \n 5 \n Face Mask 1 \n 5 \n Face Mask 2 \n 5 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 Example 2:  Acceptable \n Number of personnel \n 5 \n Bandana 1 \n \u00a0 \n Bandana 2 \n 5 \n Face Mask 1 \n \u00a0 \n Face Mask 2 \n 5 \n Example 3:  Not Acceptable \u00a0 \n Number of personnel \n 1 \n Bandana 1 \n \u00a0 \n Bandana 2 \n 3 \n Face Mask 1 \n \u00a0 \n Face Mask 2 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Face Covering Types: \n Bandana 1 \n Bandana 2 \n Face Mask 1 \n Face Mask 2 \n \n   \n 100% Cotton\u00a0 \n \n \n   \n 100% Cotton\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n   \n 100% Cotton\u00a0from a vendor (not homemade). \n \n \n \u00a0 \n   \n 100% Cotton | 2 Layers |\u00a0 200GSM \n \n Learn more on how to make your own face covering using bandanas without sewing:\u00a0 Guidance Sheet |\u00a0 Video \u00a0 \n Click here to submit a request for Face Coverings \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quick Links \n \n \n Campus Return \n \n Hotline \n \n UCR Daily Wellness Check Survey \n \n Human Resources COVID-19 Resources \n \n Student Health Services \n \n Campus Emergency Status \n \n Keep Teaching \n \n Keep Learning \n \n Keep Working \n \n Keep Researching \n \n Coronavirus Resources \n \n Face Covering Request \n \n Research Ramp Up \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ADDITIONAL INFORMATION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Contact Us \nHave a question? \n Send us an email >> \n \n \n Resources for Campus \n Downloadable resources for facilities,\u00a0including signage.\u00a0 \n See resources >> \n \u00a0 \n \n \n Campus Return \n Information about plans for a return to campus.\u00a0 \n Learn more >> \n \n \n How to protect yourself \n Latest updates from the campus and Riverside County Public Health. \n Learn more >> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n               Environmental Health & Safety \n             900 University Ave.              Riverside, CA 92521              \n  tel: (951) 827-5528                  fax: (951) 827-5122          email:  ehs@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n Coronavirus Resources & Updates \n \n Customer Service Satisfaction Survey for EH&S \n \n Emergency Management \n \n Fire & Life Safety \n \n Risk & Safety Solutions Web Application Log In \n \n Risk Management \n \n UC Police Department \n \n UC Risk & Safety Training \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
