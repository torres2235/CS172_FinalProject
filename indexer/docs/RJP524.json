For example, we may do this based on information that ad partners share with us. We hope that this increases the usefulness of Twitter Ads for you. \n Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one way it would work. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say a flower shop wants to advertise a Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day special on Twitter. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer to show their ad to floral enthusiasts who subscribe to their newsletter. To get the special offer to those people, who are also on Twitter, the shop may share with us hashed emails from their mailing list. We can then match that to a hash of emails that our users have associated with their accounts in order to show them a Promoted Tweet for the Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day deal on Twitter. \n \n Another way this works is when a person visits the flower shop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website. In that case, Twitter may collect information that enables the shop owner to advertise through Twitter and reach those visitors with a Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day offer. \n About Twitter marketing \n In addition to helping advertisers to reach their audiences on Twitter, Twitter also works with third-party advertising partners, including Google, to market Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own services, including through the delivery of interest-based ads. These partners may also serve ads on behalf of Twitter advertisers. The privacy options described below apply to interest-based ads served by Twitter; they do not apply to ads served by these other companies, including on Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf. You can learn more about opting out of receiving interest-based ads from other companies at  optout.aboutads.info  and  www.networkadvertising.org/choices . If you are on the web, you can also opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  opt-out browser add-on , and opt out of interest-based Google ads using  Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ads Settings . \n What are my privacy options? \n \n If you do not want Twitter to show you interest-based ads on and off of Twitter, there are several ways to turn off this feature: \n Using your Twitter settings, visit the  Personalization and data  settings and adjust the setting  Personalize ads . \n If you are on the web, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer choice tool at  optout.aboutads.info  to opt out of seeing interest-based advertising from Twitter in your current browser. \n If you do not want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for iOS on your current mobile device, enable the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLimit Ad Tracking\u00e2\u0080\u009d setting in your iOS phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settings. If you do not want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for Android on your current mobile device, enable \u00e2\u0080\u009cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d in your Android phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settings. \n \n \n \n \n \n Note : Please confirm that you are logged in if you want to view or change the web settings for your Twitter account. Changing your Twitter settings in your web browser when you are logged out will only affect behavior on that browser while you are not logged in to Twitter.  Learn more  about how to access your  Personalization and data  settings, including in your Twitter mobile app. \n \n \n \n \n \n Opting out of\u00c2\u00a0Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest-based ads won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop you from seeing Twitter ads altogether.\u00c2\u00a0For example, you may still see ads\u00c2\u00a0on Twitter that are personalized based on other information, including what you Tweet, who you follow, what type of phone you use, where you are, and the links you click on Twitter. \n \n \n \n \n Bookmark or share this article \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n
