There is no option to download the work in full. \n   \"Check out\u201d a copy for one hour, with an auto-renew feature for books still in active use (turning pages, clicking, or scrolling). \n   Access items 1-1: One copy on the member library shelf, one individual access to the digital copy. Two copies, two concurrent users of the digital item. \n \n How to access UCR print materials via HathiTrust \n \n Go to  hathitrust.org  and select the yellow \u201c LOG IN \u201d button. \n Select  University of California, Riverside  from the list of partner institutions. Select \u201c Continue .\" \n You will arrive at UCR\u2019s  Central Authentication Service . Enter your UCR  NetID  and  Password . \n When you have successfully logged in, you will be returned to the HathiTrust website. \n \n Review the HathiTrust  FAQ  and  Use Guide  before you get started. \n Remember:  The UCR Library staff are still available to answer questions and provide support!
