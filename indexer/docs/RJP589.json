Our fundraising profits go out to the village and allow us to deliver pads to help the women of the village. A warm welcome back to all Highlanders! UCR Project RISHI is blessed and proud to announce that we have two very amazing causes to support this year - \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2 and \ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb. We are working very closely with our sponsor village, Ghangar, which is high up in the mountain ranges of Uttarakhand, India, to make this vision a reality. The village is supported by strong, hard-working women, who face the issue of not being able to access menstrual products that are environmentally friendly. To promote their well-being and health, as well as the fertility of their farming lands, our chapter has adopted the mission of giving them accessibility to BIODEGRADABLE pads to replace plastic ones. We would also like to include BASIC English language skills in students\u2019 academic curriculums by sending over tape recordings for practice. This specific cause is still in the works - we look forward to sharing the knowledge we have with the children in order to open them up to new work and life possibilities. Every penny that we collect from the events and fundraisers our chapter hosts this year will go towards aiding our village, as well as gaining additional resources to make our volunteer trip next summer. We are so excited to share these causes with you all, and hope you take away as much as we do from lending a hand to the community. We\u2019d like to thank you for your timeless support, and here\u2019s to a great 2020-21 year for UCR PRISHI! See All Posts Project RISHI at UCR March 2  \u00b7  Board applications are open now!
