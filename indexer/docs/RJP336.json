Global population is also growing at a slower rate than at any time since 1950.  (Associated Press ) It\u2019s time to stop blaming overpopulation for our environmental woes and start looking at the factors that really matter \u2014 resource consumption and toxic exposure as population growth and fertility rates show downward trends. U.S.  and  global  populations are both growing at slower rates. In the period between July 2019 and July 2020 alone, the growth rate in the U.S. had  slowed to just 0.35% , the slowest recorded since at least 1900. And this isn\u2019t just because of a  COVID-19 baby bust . Rather, this is a part of a long-term trend, decades in the making. In 2010, births had fallen 3% from 2009,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The total fertility rate (number of births over the course of a woman\u2019s lifetime) was down 4%, and teen birth rates fell 10%, the sharpest drop in more than 70 years. Global population growth, which has stabilized, is also heading toward decline. According to the  United Nations population division , the world\u2019s population is growing at a slower rate than at any time since 1950, and will level off around 2100. A 2020  study  suggests that global population will probably reach its peak  four decades earlier  than what the U.N. projected. In any case, age structures are already shifting markedly. As of 2018,  people over 65 outnumbered children under 5  worldwide for the first time in history. While the pace is uneven, the population story of the 21st century will be one of global graying, rather than significant global growth. Yet despite slower growth, we are still speeding toward environmental catastrophe. At the same time that human fertility rates were decreasing, greenhouse emissions all over the planet were rising steadily,  hitting record levels  in 2019. A  U.N. report  on global greenhouse gas emissions found that the richest 1% of people on Earth were responsible for more than double the number of greenhouse gas emissions of the poorest 50%. To comply with the Paris agreement, the ultra-rich would need to decrease their greenhouse gas emitting behaviors by a factor of 30. Story continues The link between population and climate change is broken. In both  China  and the  U.S.  \u2014 the top two emitters of greenhouse emissions \u2014 the average woman gives birth to 1.6 children in her lifetime, below the 2.1 children needed to replace herself and her partner. There are several factors behind the fertility slowdown. Women\u2019s voluntary access to contraceptives \u2014 alongside other reproductive health services \u2014 plays a major role, as well as formal education and opportunities to earn an income outside of the household. But researchers also point to another concern: Infertility may be on the rise. The rate of pregnancy loss due to miscarriage, stillbirth and ectopic pregnancy among women of all ages in the U.S.  has been rising  at a rate of 1% per year between 1990 and 2011. Further,  an analysis of 185 studies  looking at close to 43,000 men between 1973 and 2011 found that total sperm counts had decreased by almost 60%. Researchers aren\u2019t entirely certain why \u2014 and  some researchers question  whether sperm count even impacts fertility \u2014 but  some evidence demonstrates  that exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals, like phthalates (which make plastics flexible), play a role in disrupting fertility. There\u2019s something else to consider: Young people are simply  having less sex , with fewer partners, and are having sex for the first time at later ages compared with earlier generations. Some applaud this change for reducing teen pregnancy in the U.S. But it could signal a waning desire to have children on a warming planet. Multiple   surveys  have found this phenomenon, showing that climate anxiety is on the rise, and with it, a fear of bringing babies into a world whose future isn\u2019t so rosy. My own interviews with diverse young people between the ages of 22 and 34 reveal that racial violence and climate change compete as the two main reasons they cite for being either deeply ambivalent about or outright opposed to becoming parents in the future. These very real social and environmental problems have intensified as population growth rates have declined. This alone demonstrates that stabilizing population size isn\u2019t a panacea. Social and environmental problems won\u2019t solve themselves, regardless of the number of people on Earth. Jade S. Sasser is an associate professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at UC Riverside.

Clad in a green jumpsuit and wearing a white face mask, Emma Coronel Aispuro, appeared for a court hearing in Washington, D.C., where she pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiring to distribute illegal drugs, conspiring to launder money and conspiring to assist the Sinaloa drug cartel. As part of her plea agreement, the 31-year-old former beauty queen also admitted to conspiring to helping her husband escape from a Mexican prison in 2015 when he dug a mile-long tunnel from his cell. In early 2019, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who is 64, was convicted in a high-profile Brooklyn trial of masterminding a multibillion-dollar drug enterprise. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, and locked up in the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.Coronel, a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen, married Guzman in 2007 at the age of 18. The couple has twin daughters. Coronel could face up to life in prison for the drug distribution charge alone.The other two counts against her carry maximum prison terms of 20 years and 10 years, respectively.A tentative sentencing date was set by the judge for mid-September. 1d ago Associated Press Officers not indicted in Honolulu shooting that killed teen Grand jurors have declined to indict three Honolulu police officers in a shooting that killed a 16-year-old boy.
