Sign Up FACEBOOK, INC. AND THE EU-U.S. and SWISS-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD Facebook, Inc. (\u201cFacebook\u201d) has certified to the  EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework  (collectively, \u201cPrivacy Shield Frameworks\u201d) with the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection and processing of personal data from our advertisers, customers, or business partners in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and, where a Swiss data controller uses Facebook as a data processor, Switzerland (\u201cPartners\u201d), in connection with the products and services described in the Scope section below and in our  certification , although Facebook does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program please visit  www.privacyshield.gov . Scope : Facebook adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (as set out in each of the Privacy Shield Frameworks) for the following areas of our business (collectively the \u201cPartner Services\u201d):  Workplace : Workplace is a service that allows people to more effectively collaborate and share information at work. Partners (employers or organizations - the data controllers) may submit personal information about their members to Facebook, with Facebook Ireland as the processor and Facebook, Inc. as a sub-processor. While Partners and their members decide what information to submit, it typically includes things like business contacts, customer and employee information, employee-generated content and communications, and other information under the Partner\u2019s control. For more information, members may contact the Partner through which they hold a Workplace account and review Workplace\u2019s  privacy policy . Ads and Measurement : Facebook offers Ads and Measurement products and through those services Facebook may receive personal data from unaffiliated Partners (the data controllers) where Facebook Ireland is the processor and Facebook, Inc. is a sub-processor. This includes things like contact information and information about individuals\u2019 experiences or interactions with the Partners and their products, services, and ads. For more information about our ads and measurement products, visit our  About Facebook Ads  page and our  Data Policy . Facebook uses the personal data provided by our Partners to provide Partner Services in accordance with the terms applicable to the relevant Partner Service and otherwise with the Partners\u2019 instructions.  Choice . Under the Privacy Shield Principles, individuals have the right to opt out of (i) disclosures of their personal information to third parties; or (ii) uses of their personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. As a data processor, Facebook works with its Partners to ensure that individuals are offered appropriate choices applicable under the Privacy Shield Principles. Access . Within the scope of our authorization to do so, and in accordance with our commitments under the Privacy Shield, Facebook will work with its Partners to provide individuals access to personal data about them that Facebook holds on behalf of its Partners. Facebook also will take reasonable steps to enable individuals, either directly or in connection with the Partners, to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. Third Parties . Facebook may transfer data within the  Facebook family of companies  and to third parties, including service providers and other partners. In accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Facebook is liable for any processing of personal data by such third parties that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles unless Facebook was not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage. Legal Requests . Personal data that is transferred to us by our Partners may be subject to disclosure pursuant to legal requests or other judicial and government process, such as subpoenas, warrants, or orders. For more information, review the  \u201cHow do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?\u201d  section of the Facebook Data Policy and the \u201cDisclosure of information\u201d section of the  Workplace Privacy Policy . Enforcement . Facebook\u2019s compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Questions and Disputes .

You have the option to resolve any applicable disputes you have with us in connection with our certification through TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles in each of the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
