As the population of Raza students continued to grow, CSP was relocated to a more visible space in the \u201cCommons Area.\u201d Due to renovations to this space, CSP was housed in trailers in parking lot 19 until it was moved to Costo Hall. The office is now located in 145 Costo Hall, which offers more space for offices, student meeting rooms and the planning and execution of our events.\u00a0 \n While the location of CSP has varied over the years, the mural representing the history of Raza students and CSP still remains part of the office. The wall-length mural was created by local artist Chano Gonzalez, and funded by a National Council of the Arts grant in 1975. During the first relocation of the office, the mural was threatened to be white-washed. However, student, faculty, and staff protests ensured the security of the artwork. The remaining 10 panels are now displayed at CSP\u2019s\u00a0current location. \n \n \n   \n Former Staff and Directors \n \n The program was founded by a committee that included faculty members organizing around the needs of Raza faculty and students at UCR. Dr. Eugene Cota-Robles was a microbiologist and the department chair of Chicano Studies at the time. Dr. Carlos Cort\u00e9s was a historian and Chicano studies professor. Alberto Richard Chavez was the assistant dean of student services. \n With the support of many students, staff and community members, the committee was able to advocate for a \u201chome away from home\u201d for Chicano students at the UCR campus. \n Alberto R. Chavez served as director of Chicano Student Programs for 15 years. In 1986, he was succeeded by Rebecca Chavez, who held the position for one year. Robert Nava was appointed to serve as director in 1989. Alfredo Figueroa, currently an assistant dean at UCR, served as director for another 15 years. During a one-year interim period in the early eighties, UCR alumnus Raymond Navarro also served as program director. In 2004, after having worked as CSP\u2019s student assistant, senior clerk and social/cultural programmer Estella Acu\u00f1a became CSP\u2019s present director.\u00a0 \n Support staff has included Aurora Gonzalez, Armida Amaya, Estela Figueroa, Jacalyn L\u00f3pez Garcia, Lydia Enriquez, Nora Cornejo and currently John Valdez. The social/cultural programmer position, created in 1988, has been held by Josefina Canchola, Carolyn Sandoval, Veronica O.Hernandez, Elena Perez and now Arlene Cano. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chicano Student Programs \n \n               145 Costo Hall\n             Riverside, CA 92521                          \n  tel: (951) 827-3821                         email:  estella.acuna@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n Follow US: \n \n Facebook \n Csp_UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n African Student Programs \n \n Asian Pacific Student Programs \n \n Chicano Student Programs \n \n LGBT Resource Center \n \n Native American Student Programs \n \n Middle Eastern Student Center \n \n Undocumented Student Programs \n \n Women's Resource Center \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
