Our first Performance Spotlight goes to Senryu Taiko!!! \n\nWe are Senryu Taiko, the premier Japanese drumming (taiko) group at UC Riverside. All of the members here at Senryu Taiko were drawn to the passion and intensity of taiko, and we enjoy playing and performing. We have performed all around campus and Southern California, and we are greatly involved in our local and greater community, being present in events such as the Riverside Lunar Festival, San Jose Obon, Anime Expo, Disneyland and much more. \n\nSenryu Taiko has many performances and workshops throughout the year and we greatly encourage you stay updated on our social media to learn about future events.
