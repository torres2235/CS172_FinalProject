Wilcox \n \n \n \n            Chancellor     \n \n \n \n \n  March 14, 2020\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n UPDATE:  The closure has been extended to April 30. \n Following the Riverside County Public Health order, we are required to minimize the number of people on campus as much as possible while maintaining the critical functions of the university. \n Effective Monday, March 16, the UCR campus will be closed, with only critical operations continuing. \n There are three important domains for continuing university operations, as outlined below. \n 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Academic Instruction and Student Support \n Winter quarter final exams will proceed remotely as planned. \n All instruction (including but not limited to labs, studios, and directed studies) will be delivered remotely for the entirety of the spring quarter. This is a change from the April 3 end date for remote instruction.\u00a0 \n On campus housing and residential dining services remain open and residents can elect to remain on campus if needed. \n To facilitate remote instruction and learning, ITS is identifying solutions for those instructors, teaching assistants, and students who are in\u00a0 urgent \u00a0need of laptops and internet access.\u00a0 \n 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Research Operations \n Many research operations are critical campus functions, and those deemed critical will be allowed to continue their work on campus, following important social distancing and hygiene measures. Deans and department chairs will be working with principal investigators to determine critical research functions that must continue on campus, with guidance from the Provost and the Vice Chancellor for Research and Economic Development. \n 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Health Services \n All clinical and health services, including Student Health Services, will continue as critical campus functions. \u00a0 \n Employees will work remotely if feasible, and only essential personnel supporting critical campus functions will be allowed\u00a0continue their work on campus.\u00a0 \n Deans, chairs, and supervisors will be identifying critical campus functions, and we expect that employees will be updated before Monday. \n Moreover,\u00a0 all non-essential domestic and international travel will be suspended , effective Monday, March 16 and until further notice. \n Please anticipate additional communications and guidance in response to the outbreak and campus closure, as the situation is rapidly changing. Major campus-wide updates will continue to be posted to the\u00a0 COVID-19 website . \n Finally, many of you have heard me say that a university is more than a set of classrooms, buildings, or facilities. At its core, a university is about people. As we work together to confront these unprecedented challenges, I am tremendously grateful to each of you for your continued patience, flexibility, and commitment to UCR. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Announcements \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Time to vaccinate \n \n June 11, 2021 \n Read More \u00bb \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Presidential Campus Safety Plan \n \n June 1, 2021 \n Read More \u00bb \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chancellor\u2019s Update - May 2021 \n \n May 26, 2021 \n Read More \u00bb \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Salary increase for policy-covered staff and academic employees \n \n May 17, 2021 \n Read More \u00bb \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n               900 University Ave.\n             Riverside, CA 92521                          \n  tel: (951) 827-0000                         email:  webmaster@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n Follow US: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n UCR News \n \n Research Blog \n \n Inside UCR Archive \n \n Human Resources \n \n UC Path Portal \n \n Staff Assembly \n \n UC Newsroom \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
