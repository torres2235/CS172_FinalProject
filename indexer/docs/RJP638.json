Brad\u00e1n Accountants July 11, 2014  \u00b7  HSE: Around 10,000 discretionary medical cards now returned after review   The HSE has said that more than two-thirds of people who lost their discretionary medical cards in the controversial review have now had them returned.  It has told the Oireachtas Health Committee that around 10,000 people have now received their cards back after the recent review.  Officials say the remaining 5,000 people affected by the review will have them back by the end of next week. ...  Do you know that as a medical card holder your USC & PRSI liabilities are different?  Medical card holders pay the Universal Social Charge on their income (except for social welfare and HSE payments), but at a maximum rate of 4%. The only exemption is for people earning less than \u20ac10,036 per annum. Medical card holders may also be exempt from paying school transport charge  and State exam fees in publicly-funded second-level schools. There may also be financial help with buying school books in certain schools.  Employees who are Medical Card holders; recipients of Social Welfare Widow's/Widower's Pension; One Parent Family Payment; Deserted Wife's Benefit, or certain EU pensions and payments, are exempt from the Health element of the PRSI contribution (i.e. they are liable at the sub-class of contribution - A2, B2, C2, etc.).   If you require any help on this area are applying for a refund please do not hesitate to contact us.
