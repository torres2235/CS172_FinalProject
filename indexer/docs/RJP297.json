All of our programs are accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs. \n Teachers provide developmentally appropriate experiences in math, science, language, art, music, motor skills and social/emotional skills. They use a range of learning materials including books, puzzles, computers and art materials with regular access to outdoor play equipment. Teachers follow a daily schedule, prepare weekly lesson plans and conduct two parent-teacher conferences each year. Parents receive a written progress report at the end of each year. \n We provide breakfast, lunch and a morning and/or afternoon snack. Our active parent association meets regularly to plan family-oriented events and fundraisers. Students and researchers are welcome at ECS, which features observation rooms that are available to parents as well. \n 2020-21 Events Calendar \n Date \n Virtual Kindergarten Orientation \n September 2, 2020 \n ECS Staff Development (Center Closed) \n \n September 3-4 \n \n Labor Day Holiday (Center Closed) \n September 7 \n Kindergarten Program Begins \n September 8 \n Kindergarten Pre-Assessment & Virtual Parent Conference \n September 28\u2013October 2 \n Virtual Family Back to School Night \n October\u00a015 \n Veteran's Day (Center Closed) \n November\u00a011 \n Picture Day \n POSTPONED \n Thanksgiving Holiday (Center Closed) \n November 26-27 \n Virtual Parent/Teacher Conferences (Kindergarten) \n December 7-11 \n Winter Break \n December 24 -January 1 \n Center Re-opens \n January 4 \n Teacher Training In-service Day (Center Closed) \n January 15 \n Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday (Center Closed) \n January 18 \n Presidents Day (Center Closed) \n February 15 \n Ceasar Chavez Observed (Center Closed) \n March 26 \n Vision Screening \n POSTPONED \n Teacher Appreciation Week \n May 3-7 \n Teacher Training In-service Day (Center Closed) \n May 28 \n Memorial Day Holiday (Center Closed) \n May 31 \n Kindergarten Promotion \n June 11 \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hours of Operation \n Full Day Program \n7:30am - 5:30pm \n Full Day Kindergarten \n7:30am - 5:30pm \n School Day Kindergarten \n8:30am - 2:30pm \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n UC Riverside's Early Childhood Services is proud to be fully accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. \n CHILD CARE Applications \n WAITING LIST Inquiries \n \u00a0 Meet Our Staff \n \u00a0 Class Schedules \n \u00a0 What to Expect \n   \n We believe that children learn best in an environment that is safe, nurturing and child-centered.
