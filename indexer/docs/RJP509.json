Common reasons for suspension may include: \n Spam : Most of the accounts we suspend are suspended because they are spammy, or just plain fake, and they introduce security risks for Twitter and all of our users. These types of accounts are against our  Twitter Rules . Unfortunately, sometimes a real person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account gets suspended by mistake, and in those cases we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work with the person to make sure the account is unsuspended. \n \n Account security at risk : If we suspect an account has been hacked or compromised, we may suspend it until it can be secured and restored to the account owner in order to reduce potentially malicious activity caused by the compromise. \n \n Abusive Tweets or behavior : We may suspend an account if it has been reported to us as violating our Rules surrounding abuse. When an account engages in abusive behavior, like sending threats to others or impersonating other accounts, we may suspend it temporarily or, in some cases, permanently. \n \n Can I unsuspend my account? \n \n You may be able to unsuspend your own account.  If you log in and see prompts that ask you to provide your  phone number  or confirm your email address, follow the instructions to get your account unsuspended. \n Are you seeing a message that your account is locked?  Your account may also be temporarily disabled in response to reports of spammy or abusive behavior. For example, you may be prevented from Tweeting from your account for a specific period of time or you may be asked to verify certain information about yourself before proceeding. Get  help unlocking your account . \n \n File an appeal and we may be able to unsuspend your account.  If you are unable to unsuspend your own account using the instructions above and you think that we made a mistake suspending or locking your account, you can appeal. First, log in to the account that is suspended. Then, open a new browser tab and  file an appeal .\u00c2\u00a0 \n More about the Twitter Rules \n \n In the  Twitter Rules , we describe the circumstances that could lead to account suspension or other policy enforcement actions. Find more specifics about our  abusive behavior policy . \n Read some tips on  best practices for using Twitter  (information about how many users you can follow, how to participate in Trends, how many replies to a single account are too many, etc.). \n \n How to deactivate your suspended accounts \n To deactivate your suspended account, please submit a request  here .\u00c2\u00a0 Requests can also be addressed to the contacts listed under the \u00e2\u0080\u009c How To Contact Us section of our Privacy Policy \u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Please note that Twitter might retain some information on your deactivated account to insure the safety and security of its platform and users. More information can be found  here . \n How to request a copy of your personal information \n Suspended accounts can submit a request to access their information  here. Requests can also be addressed to the contacts listed under the \u00e2\u0080\u009c How To Contact Us section of our Privacy Policy \u00e2\u0080\u009d. \n \u00c2\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Bookmark or share this article \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Scroll to top\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              Twitter platform\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Twitter.com\n               \n \n \n \n                 Status\n               \n \n \n \n                 Card validator\n               \n \n \n \n                 Privacy Center\n               \n \n \n \n                 Transparency Center\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Twitter, Inc.\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 About the company\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter for Good\n               \n \n \n \n                 Company news\n               \n \n \n \n                 Brand toolkit\n               \n \n \n \n                 Jobs and internships\n               \n \n \n \n                 Investors\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Help\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Help Center\n               \n \n \n \n                 Using Twitter\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter Media\n               \n \n \n \n                 Ads Help Center\n               \n \n \n \n                 Managing your account\n               \n \n \n \n                 Safety and security\n               \n \n \n \n                 Rules and policies\n               \n \n \n \n                 Contact us\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Developer resources\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Developer home\n               \n \n \n \n                 Documentation\n               \n \n \n \n                 Forums\n               \n \n \n \n                 Communities\n               \n \n \n \n                 Developer blog\n               \n \n \n \n                 Engineering blog\n               \n \n \n \n                 Developer terms\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Business resources\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Advertise\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter for business\n               \n \n \n \n                 Resources and guides\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter for marketers\n               \n \n \n \n                 Marketing insights\n               \n \n \n \n                 Brand inspiration\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter Data\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter Flight School\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \u00a9 2021 Twitter, Inc.\n           \n \n \n \n              Cookies\n             \n \n \n \n              Privacy\n             \n \n \n \n              Terms and conditions\n             \n \n \n \n \n    English\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Help Center \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              English\n             \n \n \n \n              Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa\u009e\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00ed\u0095\u009c\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u0096\u00b4 \n             \n \n \n \n              Portugu\u00c3\u00aas \n             \n \n \n \n              Deutsch\n             \n \n \n \n              T\u00c3\u00bcrk\u00c3\u00a7e\n             \n \n \n \n              Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais\n             \n \n \n \n              Italiano \n             \n \n \n \n              \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u0084\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u008a\u00d9\u0091\u00d8\u00a9\n             \n \n \n \n              Nederlands\n             \n \n \n \n              Bahasa Indonesia \n             \n \n \n \n              \u00d0\u00a0\u00d1\u0083\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00e0\u00a4\u00b9\u00e0\u00a4\u00bf\u00e0\u00a4\u0082\u00e0\u00a4\u00a6\u00e0\u00a5\u0080\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00e7\u00ae\u0080\u00e4\u00bd\u0093\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087\n             \n \n \n \n              Polski\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            By using Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services you agree to our  Cookies Use .
