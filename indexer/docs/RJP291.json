Depending on the scope of the shutdown, there are simple steps you can follow to ensure the safety of your laboratory and the people who work in it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Learn what to do before, during, and after a power failure in a laboratory. \n \n \n \n \n \n            BEFORE the power fails     \n \n Contact.\u00a0 Post emergency contact phone numbers on the lab safety sign in the hallway outside your lab.\u00a0 Contact your \u00a0EH&S Research Safety Specialist to make changes to this sign \n Flashlights.\u00a0 Equip your emergency/spill kit with a battery powered flashlight. \n Chemicals.\u00a0 Do not leave open chemicals in the fume hood when the fume hood is unattended. Always safely store chemicals after use. \n Electrical.\u00a0 Put essential equipment on emergency power circuits.\n\t Install appropriately-sized surge protection devices for all sensitive or expensive electronics. \n Consult with Facilities Services if you need to install an uninterruptible power source (ups) or other backup electrical systems or equipment. \n \n Equipment.\u00a0 Make a list of equipment that must be reset, reprogrammed, restarted, or recalibrated once power returns.\u00a0\n\t Post the list in a conspicuous place. \n Program equipment that operates unattended to shut down safely during a power failure and not restart automatically when power returns. \n \n Dry Ice.\u00a0 Identify an emergency source of dry ice, if you have items that must be kept cold.\u00a0 Note: Refrigerators and freezers will maintain their temperature for several hours if they are not opened. Do not use dry ice in walk-in refrigerators or other confined areas. \n \n \n \n \n \n            DURING the power outage     \n \n Bio/Chem/Rad.\u00a0 Shut down experiments that involve hazardous materials.\u00a0 Make sure experiments are stable and won't create uncontrolled hazards. \n Fume hoods & Biosafety Cabinets.\u00a0 Check fume hoods and biosafety cabinets and take the following precautions, if applicable:\u00a0\n\t Stop any operations that may be emitting hazardous vapors, fumes, or infectious agents. \n Securely cap any open containers. \n Close fume hood and biosafety cabinet sashes. \n \n Electrical.\u00a0 Check equipment on emergency power to ensure it's running properly.\u00a0 Note: It may take 20 to 30 seconds for emergency power to activate after a power failure. \n Power surges.\u00a0 Reduce electrical use and risk of power surges by:\u00a0\n\t Disconnecting from emergency outlets equipment that runs unattended, and \n Turning off unnecessary lights and equipment. \n \n Temperature control.\u00a0 Transfer vulnerable items from cold rooms and refrigerators that have lost power to equipment served by emergency power. \n \n \n \n \n \n            AFTER the power returns     \n \n Check equipment \n Reset and restart equipment\n\t If building systems, including fume hoods, fail to restart or operate correctly, contact Facilities Services \n If non-building equipment fails to restart or operate correctly, contact the manufacturer or service provider. \n \n Confirm air flow in your fume hood is restored. \n Recalibrate and reprogram equipment as necessary. \n Keep doors closed on refrigerators and freezers that failed until they have been repaired and returned to safe working temperature.\u00a0 \n Note: Some refrigerators and freezers require a manual restart. \n Notify \n If system or equipment failures create hazardous conditions, immediately notify:\u00a0\n\t During business hours contact Environmental Health & Safety (951) 827-5528 \n After business hours contact Police by dialing 911 or from a campus phone (951) 827-5222 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n               Environmental Health & Safety \n             900 University Ave.              Riverside, CA 92521              \n  tel: (951) 827-5528                  fax: (951) 827-5122          email:  ehs@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n Coronavirus Resources & Updates \n \n Customer Service Satisfaction Survey for EH&S \n \n Emergency Management \n \n Fire & Life Safety \n \n Risk & Safety Solutions Web Application Log In \n \n Risk Management \n \n UC Police Department \n \n UC Risk & Safety Training \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
