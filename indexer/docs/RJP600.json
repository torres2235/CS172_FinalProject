I am a Bulosan Center for Filipino Studies intern and Mga Kapatid's Co-Cultural Community Chair and API Representative for the next academic year. \n\nI know that I have never met any of y'all nor do I even attend UCR; however, I am aware of your platform as an organization and want to reach out to you in the hopes that y'all can create a letter of solidarity for the Bulosan Center that aims to support Filipinx and Filipinx American Studies nationwide and even outside of that. You will not have to write a letter from scratch as a uniform letter is already created for organizations to add their names and logo to.\n\nDuring Filipinx Advocacy Day, we were able to get the support of Assemblymember Rob Bonta to advocate for funds of $1 MILLION for the Bulosan Center, but this again does not guarantee that the fund will be granted to the center. I know that this is short notice, but I am currently reaching out to organizations on and off campus all over California to complete this by Thursday morning the latest! Dr. Robyn Rodriguez, other faculty and myself along with other interns will be going to the Capitol this Thursday afternoon to distribute the letters and to make known numbers of marginalized folx advocating support for this fund for the Bulosan Center. The impact of this is very dependent on the Filipinx/FilAm communities as well as our allies! \n\nIf it is within your capacity and your organization's capacity to do so as a platform, all that I ask is that the following is done:\n\n1) Have YOU and/or AS MANY of your MEMBERS fill out the Google Form. The organization only has to submit one letter.\n https://docs.google.com/\u2026/1FAI\u2026/viewform \n\n2) Download a copy of the Sample Letter.\n https://docs.google.com/\u2026/11P2jU39\u2026/edit \n\n3) Put your organization\u2019s logo in the header and sign as followed:\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Insert Organization Name] Represented by the Organization\u2019s Board Members (2019-2020) << If applicable.\n\n[Insert board member\u2019s positions and names listed]\n\n4) Send the edited letter document to TheBulosanCenter@gmail.com BY THURSDAY at NOON the latest.\n\n5) If within your capacity, please share this information and instructions to any other orgs, allies, or networks that you have connections with. Individuals who are not a part of organizations are in a position to support as well by simply filling out the Google Form linked in Step 1.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the letter, steps or are looking for other ways to support outside of this, feel free to contact me via PM or email. \n\nMy email is:\ndaamiranda@ucdavis.edu\n\nIsang Bagsak!
