By successfully linking individuals\u2019 goals to an organization\u2019s strategy, organizations ensure their priorities are a primary focus and employees prioritize their work based on the goals of the business unit. \n Setting goals is an essential part of being an effective leader and employee. Effective goals motivate and inspire, increase success rates, allow an action plan focus, and reduce frustration. An effective goal setting process helps us understand where we are currently, choose where we want to go, and assesses the best steps to take to reach our outcome goals. \n When you set goals, you\u2019ll want to be SMART about it: \n \n Specific \n Measurable \n Aligned with team goals \n Relevant \n Timely \n \n Course Fee \n No fee \n Registration \n To attend this workshop, please register at the  UC Learning Center (LMS) . \n \n \n \n \n  Tuesday, June 15 at 10:30am\n           \n\n          \n            to  12:00pm \n \n  Virtual Event\n        \n       \n \n \n \n \n Audience \n \n \n Faculty & Staff \n \n \n Website \n \n \n https://hr.ucr.edu/event-list/2021/06... \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Subscribe \n \n Google Calendar \n iCal \n Outlook \n \n \n \n \n Recent Activity \n \n \n \n Comment \n Review \n Photo \n \n \n \n No recent activity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Watch This\n             \n \n  I'm Interested\n               \n \n \n \n  Invite Friends\n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People Interested (4) \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search for: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n                        900 University Ave. \n                        Riverside, CA 92521 \n                        Tel: (951) 827-1012\n                     \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n             900 University Ave.\n                             Riverside, CA 92521              \n \n                        Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n                        E-mail:  webmaster@ucr.edu \n \n \n   Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n RELATED LINKS \n \n Campus Map \n Transportation and Parking Services \n Riverside Convention and Visitors Bureau \n \n \n Follow us: \n \n Facebook \n Twitter \n YouTube \n Instagram \n LinkedIn \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This event content is powered by the Localist Community Event Platform. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Login to UC Riverside  Events Calendar \n \n UCR Users: \n You may login with your UCR NetID \n \n \n \n \n \n Login with School ID \n \n \n \n All Other Users: \n When creating an account, please create it with your first and last name, otherwise, it may be deleted. \n \n \n \n \n Login with Facebook \n Login with LinkedIn \n Login with Twitter \n \n \n \n \n \n Email Address \n \n \n \n Password \n \n \n \n \n Forgot Password? \n \n Sign Up \n \n \n \n Note on Event Submission: \n In order to submit events, users must have a UCR email address (@ucr.edu).
