Anticipating and planning UCR's campus emergency response minimizes possible injuries and property damage during a campus-wide emergency and eases the return to normal campus operations.  \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            Utility Outages     \n \n Immediate Actions \n Electricity\u00a0 (power failure) \n Evacuate darkened areas with caution \n If working with high heat, open flame, or a hazardous experiment or procedure, complete safety shutdown procedures\u00a0 if it is safe to do so , and then evacuate the building \n Call Facility\u00a0Services at (951)\u00a0827-4214 (8:00 am - 5:00 pm) or Steam Plant at (951)\u00a0827-4677 (after 5:00 pm or weekends/holidays), then call UCPD at (951)\u00a0827-5222 \n Report the location and hazards of machinery or operations that were interrupted \n Report emergencies to UCPD at 911 \n Riverside Public Utilities outage map \n Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) \n When severe weather and fire conditions threaten a portion of the electric infrastructure or community,\u00a0 Southern California Edison may turn off electricity supply to Riverside Public Utilities\u00a0in the interest of public safety. \n Public Safety Power Shutoff's may occur with as little as a day's notice and can remain active for days. It is best to be prepared for a power outage at all times.\u00a0 \n In the event of a PSPS, recharging stations will be setup by the University prioritizing students with medical needs or other vital functions.\u00a0 \n How to Prepare for a Power Outage in a Laboratory \n Be sure the contact information on your lab door placard is up-to-date. Ideally, contacts should be knowledgeable about all of the lab\u2019s sensitive operations. \n Put essential equipment on emergency power circuits, if available. \n Hazardous processes that operate unattended should be programmed to shut down safely during a power failure and not restart automatically when power returns. \n Identify an emergency source of dry ice for items that must be kept cold. Do not use dry ice in small enclosed and occupied areas because hazardous concentrations of CO2 can accumulate. Unopened refrigerators/ freezers will maintain temperature for several hours. \n During Power Outage in a Laboratory \n Shut down experiments that involve hazardous materials or equipment that automatically restart when power is available. \n Make sure that experiments are stable. Cap all chemical containers that are safe to cap, and then close fume hood sashes. \n Check equipment on emergency power. In some cases, it may take 20 to 30 seconds for the emergency power to activate after a power failure. \n Disconnect unattended equipment and turn off unnecessary equipment. \n When power returns, reset/restart/check equipment. Check the airflow of your fume hood. Often, hoods will not automatically restart. \n Learn more about how to prepare before, during and after a  power outage \n Elevator\u00a0 (failure) \n Report elevator failures to Facility\u00a0Services\u00a0at (951) 827-4214 (8:00 am - 5:00 pm) or Steam Plant at (951) 827-4677 (after 5:00 pm or weekends/holidays), then call UCPD at (951) 827-5222 \n If outside the elevator, try to communicate to trapped elevator occupants that help is on the way \n If trapped inside the elevator, use the elevator phone to request help, or activate the emergency alarm within the elevator (The elevator phone has no dial tone so do not hang up after picking up the receiver) \n Flooding\u00a0 (plumbing failure) \n Do not touch any electrical appliances \n Call Facility\u00a0Services at (951) 827-4214 (8:00 am - 5:00 pm) or Steam Plant at (951) 827-4677 (after 5:00 pm or weekends/holidays), then call UCPD at (951) 827-5222 \n If it is safe to do so, lift valuable, or critical,\u00a0items above the reach of the water \n Gas leak\u00a0 (natural gas) \n Evacuate the building using evacuation routes \n Do not turn \"on/off\" switches on lights or electrical equipment \n If working with high heat, open flame, or a hazardous experiment or procedure, complete safety shutdown procedures\u00a0 if it is safe to do so , and then evacuate the building \n Stay to the right of hallways and stairs; do not use elevators \n Assist people with disabilities if needed \n Once outside, call UCPD at 911 \n Go to the building's Emergency Assembly Area (EAA) and notify emergency staff that you have evacuated safely \n Steam Line failure \n Leave the immediate area \n Call Facility\u00a0Services at (951) 827-4214 (8:00 am - 5:00 pm) or Steam Plant at (951) 827-4677 (after 5:00 pm or weekends/holidays), then call UCPD at (951) 827-5222 \n Ventilation problem\u00a0 (odors) \n Call Facility\u00a0Services at (951) 827-4214 (8:00 am - 5:00 pm) or Steam Plant at (951) 827-4677 (after 5:00 pm or weekends/holidays), then call UCPD at (951) 827-5222 \n \n \n \n \n \n            Earthquake      \n \n Immediate Actions \n Indoors:\u00a0 \n Drop  to the floor immediately \n Take  Cover  under sturdy furniture or near an interior wall \n \u00a0 Hold On  until the shaking\u00a0stops\u00a0 \n Outdoors: \n Move away from buildings \n Drop, Cover, and Hold on \n If you are driving\u00a0pull over to a clear area \n Other Tips: \n Stay away from windows \n Stay away from things that could fall on you \n Do\u00a0not run outside \n Don't\u00a0stand in a doorway (It's not safe for shelter) \n Do not use the elevator \n \n \n \n \n \n            Exposure to Blood or Bodily Fluids      \n \n Definition \n Exposure .
