His gesture sparked a movement by fellow students, which eventually developed into today\u2019s CSES. The team\u2019s simple setup of just one telephone and an answering machine has grown into over ten \u201cred phones\u201d spread across campus and a dedicated, professional, and organized team. However, through its growth, the goal has always been the same: keep the campus community safe. \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Women's Resource Center \n \n               260 Costo Hall\n             Riverside, CA 92521                          \n  tel: (951) 827-3337                         email:  wrc@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n Follow US: \n \n Facebook \n Instagram \n Flickr \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n African Student Programs \n \n Asian Pacific Student Programs \n \n Chicano Student Programs \n \n LGBT Resource Center \n \n Native American Student Programs \n \n Middle Eastern Student Center \n \n Undocumented Student Programs \n \n Women's Resource Center \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
