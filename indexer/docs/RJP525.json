You can use these controls to better personalize your experience on Twitter, and\u00c2\u00a0to make informed choices about whether we collect certain data, how we use it, and how we share it. You\u00c2\u00a0can also disable\u00c2\u00a0all of these features with a single master setting found at the top of the screen. \n Where can I find my Personalization and data settings? \n \n On desktop web, visit the  Personalization and data  settings page. This page can be accessed both when you are logged in to Twitter and when you are logged out. The settings you see when you are logged in to your Twitter account will apply whenever you are logged in to that account on any device, whether web or mobile. The settings you see when you are logged out only affect your current browser, and only when you are not logged in to Twitter. \n On Twitter for iOS and Android: Tap the icon of your  profile  photo in the upper-left corner, select  Settings and privacy , select  Privacy and safety , and tap  Personalization and data . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Scroll to top\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              Twitter platform\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Twitter.com\n               \n \n \n \n                 Status\n               \n \n \n \n                 Card validator\n               \n \n \n \n                 Privacy Center\n               \n \n \n \n                 Transparency Center\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Twitter, Inc.\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 About the company\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter for Good\n               \n \n \n \n                 Company news\n               \n \n \n \n                 Brand toolkit\n               \n \n \n \n                 Jobs and internships\n               \n \n \n \n                 Investors\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Help\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Help Center\n               \n \n \n \n                 Using Twitter\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter Media\n               \n \n \n \n                 Ads Help Center\n               \n \n \n \n                 Managing your account\n               \n \n \n \n                 Safety and security\n               \n \n \n \n                 Rules and policies\n               \n \n \n \n                 Contact us\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Developer resources\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Developer home\n               \n \n \n \n                 Documentation\n               \n \n \n \n                 Forums\n               \n \n \n \n                 Communities\n               \n \n \n \n                 Developer blog\n               \n \n \n \n                 Engineering blog\n               \n \n \n \n                 Developer terms\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n              Business resources\n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Advertise\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter for business\n               \n \n \n \n                 Resources and guides\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter for marketers\n               \n \n \n \n                 Marketing insights\n               \n \n \n \n                 Brand inspiration\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter Data\n               \n \n \n \n                 Twitter Flight School\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \u00a9 2021 Twitter, Inc.\n           \n \n \n \n              Cookies\n             \n \n \n \n              Privacy\n             \n \n \n \n              Terms and conditions\n             \n \n \n \n \n    English\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Help Center \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              English\n             \n \n \n \n              Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa\u009e\n             \n \n \n \n              \u00ed\u0095\u009c\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u0096\u00b4 \n             \n \n \n \n              Portugu\u00c3\u00aas \n             \n \n \n \n              Deutsch\n             \n \n \n \n              T\u00c3\u00bcrk\u00c3\u00a7e\n             \n \n \n \n              Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais\n             \n \n \n \n              Italiano \n             \n \n \n \n              \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u0084\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u008a\u00d9\u0091\u00d8\u00a9\n             \n \n \n \n              Nederlands\n             \n \n \n \n              Bahasa Indonesia \n             \n \n \n \n              \u00d0\u00a0\u00d1\u0083\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9\n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            By using Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services you agree to our  Cookies Use .
