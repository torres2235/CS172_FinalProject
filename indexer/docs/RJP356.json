\n \n \n Tuition & financial aid \n \n \n Types of aid \n \n \n Who can get financial aid  \n \n California Dream Act  \n \n \n \n \n \n California Dream Act  \n \n \n The California Dream Act extends eligibility for certain types of UC and California financial aid to students, including undocumented students, who qualify for a  nonresident tuition exemption under AB 540. \n \n Undocumented students (AB 540 eligible) \n Nonresident U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens (AB 540 eligible) \n \n Undocumented students \n As an undocumented student, you may be eligible for state and UC aid, as well as private scholarships. Undocumented students are ineligible for federal aid (including federal loans and grants, and the federal work-study program), but now have the option to borrow student loans through the  DREAM Loan Program. \n What you need to do \n If you think you meet the requirements for an  AB 540 nonresident tuition exemption , here's how to make sure you're considered for financial aid: \n \n 1. Submit your application for admission to UC.  When you fill out the  application for undergraduate admission , you're automatically considered for a number of  UC scholarships . \n \n \n 2. File a  California Dream Act Application  between October 1, 2018 and March 2, 2019.  When you do this, you\u2019ll need to confirm that you\u2019ve registered for the  Selective Service  (if you\u2019re a male under age 26). If you have a valid Social Security number, you can register online. If not, you'll need to register in-person at any U.S. Post office.\u00a0 Learn more about filling out the California Dream Act Application\u00a0\u00bb \n \n \n 3. Make sure your GPA has been submitted for a Cal Grant (in addition to the California Dream Act Application).  California community colleges and most California high schools automatically submit students' GPAs for Cal Grants. Check with your school to make sure; if they don't automatically submit your GPA, download the  Cal Grant GPA Verification Form  and have your school submit it to the California Student Aid Commission. \n \n \n 4.  Once you've been accepted to a UC campus,  submit a  Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) \u00a0at your intended campus. \n \n \n 5.  After the campus receives your SIR, you'll need to  submit a  Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) \u00a0to the campus residence deputy. \n \n \n 6.  If you then receive a nonresident classification,  complete the AB 540 nonresident tuition exemption forms , which you can get at your campus registrar\u2019s office.    If you're an undocumented student and are not eligible for an AB 540 nonresident tuition exemption, you will be ineligible for all federal, state and institutional aid. Private loans and scholarships are the only financial aid options. \n \n Visit  Educators for Fair Consideration (E4FC)  for more information specific to undocumented students. \n What about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)? \n DACA  entitles students to be employed legally \u2013 which makes it much easier for students to find jobs to help cover some of their educational costs. \n If you have DACA status, you should  not  fill out a FAFSA, even if you have a Social Security number. If you\u2019re anticipating being eligible for AB 540, you should still fill out the Cal Dream Act application. \n DACA has no effect on eligibility for the AB 540 nonresident tuition exemption or financial aid. \n Nonresident U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens (AB 540 eligible) \n If you are a citizen or eligible non-citizen, and meet the requirements for an  AB 540 nonresident tuition exemption , you may qualify for state aid, in addition to federal and UC aid. \n Follow the steps above, except instead of filing a California Dream Act Application, file a  Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tuition & financial aid \n \n \n Apply for financial aid \n \n \n Types of aid \n \n Grants & scholarships \n Loans \n Jobs & work-study \n Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan  \n Middle Class Scholarship Program \n California DREAM Loan Program \n \n Who can get financial aid  \n \n California Dream Act  \n \n \n \n \n How aid works \n Estimate your aid  \n \n Tuition & cost of attendance \n \n Glossary & resources \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More resources & information  \n \n Visit UC\u2019s  undocumented student resource site  for programs and services to help you transition to and succeed at UC. \n Find out if you qualify for an  AB 540 nonresident tuition exemption . \n See our  tips for completing the California Dream Act application. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n Tuition & financial aid \n \n \n Apply for financial aid \n \n \n Types of aid \n \n Grants & scholarships \n Loans \n Jobs & work-study \n Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan  \n Middle Class Scholarship Program \n California DREAM Loan Program \n \n Who can get financial aid  \n \n California Dream Act  \n \n \n \n \n How aid works \n Estimate your aid  \n \n Tuition & cost of attendance \n \n Glossary & resources \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Admissions \n \n \n \n \n universityofcalifornia.edu \n \n Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n Terms of use \n \n \n Counselors \n \n \n Contact us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
