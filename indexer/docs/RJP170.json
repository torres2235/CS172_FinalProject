When loaded with \"Bear Bucks\" or \"Dining Dollars,\" your R\u2019Card can be used as a debit card at select locations across campus. \n Follow steps to create your R\u2019Card. \n Step One: Create Your Account \n If you haven't already done so, create your online student account at  myaccount.ucr.edu . You'll need to know your login info to submit your photo and proof of identity. \n Step Two: Review Your Info on R'Web \n Mailing address:  Your R\u2019Card will mail to the permanent US-based address on file in the Student Information System.  Will it reach you?  Go to the  R'Web portal , then  Personal Information , and  Addresses and Phone Numbers  to confirm or update. Note: R\u2019Cards requested after  September 3rd  will be held for pick up from the Highlander Service Station. \n Your name on your R\u2019Card:  You can overwrite your legal name with a nickname on your R\u2019Card if you choose the  Preferred Name  option. If you do, wait two days before moving on to Step 3. \n Step Three: Submit Your Photo and Proof of Identity \n Log in to  myphoto.ucr.edu  with your NetID and password. Carefully follow the instructions on that page to submit both an  approved photo  and  proof of identity  (a government-issued ID). \n Your ID Photo: \n Follow MyPhoto guidelines \n One photo submission per person \n Card Services reserves the right to refuse any photos that do not meet requirements. \n Proof of Identity: \n Submit a picture of a government-issued photo ID (valid English-language passport, driver\u2019s license, US Military identification card, etc.) that includes your photo, name, and date-of-birth. \n For students without a government-issued photo ID, you may substitute the  R\u2019Card Notarized Identity Verification Form  as long as it is certified (bears the seal) by a Notary Public. \n Messages from MyPhoto: \n Email #1 will confirm the submission of materials. \n Email #2 will let you know if your submission is approved. If it is disproved, make requested corrections before resubmitting. \n Step Four: Receiving Your R'Card \n An approval message from MyPhoto means your ID is ready to be printed and mailed. Please allow two weeks for delivery by USPS. We will mail R\u2019Cards to the permanent address through September 3rd. \n The R\u2019Card fee is $30. Please ensure payment to avoid monthly late fees. \n Other help: \n Replace My R\u2019Card \n Find answers to common questions \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n UCR Card Services \n \n               Highlander Service Station\n             (Next to the UCR Bookstore, in the HUB Upper Plaza)                          \n  tel: (951) 827-2273                  fax: (951) 827-2235          email:  cardingoffice@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n My Card Account \n \n Dining Services \n \n Housing Services \n \n Student Recreation Center \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
