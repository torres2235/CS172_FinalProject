However, the Worksite Specific Plan must be completed as soon as possible. Any updates to the plan will require new signatures. \n I would like to get approval to return to campus to conduct research. Do I need to complete both the Research Ramp Up Agreement and the Worksite Specific Plan? \n\tNo. The Worksite Specific Plan provides a comprehensive risk assessment of the worksite and outlines how supervisors will implement coronavirus prevention. \n Are electronic signatures allowed? \n\tYes, electronic signatures will suffice. \n Who needs to sign the plan? \n\tComplete plans and documents must include signatures from all personnel including students, graduate students, post docs, staff, visitors, etc. \n I don't know the square footage of the room. Where can I find that information? \n\tRoom information can be provided by Sharyl Murdock.\u00a0 \n Do I need to complete the Worksite Specific Plan if I am working remotely at home and don't anticipate to return to campus? \n\tNo. Since you are not physically coming to campus, you do not need to complete the worksite specific plan at this time. Prior to you returning to campus, you will need to complete all the items in the  Return to Work protocols .\u00a0 \n I manage a core facility and I have my own lab. Do I need to submit separate plans? \n\tYes. Core facilities will need to develop their own plan for their workers in the workspace. The core directors must also ensure that other users (those that are not under their direct chain of command) are aware of the core director's worksite specific assessment/mitigation measures. \n What other requirements do I need to do with the completed and signed plan? \n\tCompleted and signed plans should be posted in the labs. \n Who can I contact if I need help completing the Worksite Specific Plan? Please contact the  Operations Continuity\u00a0Workgroup . \n Is this only for research activities? No, any workers returning to campus must complete the plan. It is the supervisor's responsibility to complete the plan and have all employees review and acknowledge. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n               Environmental Health & Safety \n             900 University Ave.              Riverside, CA 92521              \n  tel: (951) 827-5528                  fax: (951) 827-5122          email:  ehs@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n Coronavirus Resources & Updates \n \n Customer Service Satisfaction Survey for EH&S \n \n Emergency Management \n \n Fire & Life Safety \n \n Risk & Safety Solutions Web Application Log In \n \n Risk Management \n \n UC Police Department \n \n UC Risk & Safety Training \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
