There are different types of vaccines, but they all have the same purpose. The first one ever created was for smallpox. A doctor realized that people who got a milder but similar virus called cowpox seemed to be immune to smallpox. By fighting off cowpox, the body had learned to recognize smallpox and produce antibodies to ward it off. This is fundamentally how vaccines function today. Teaching the body to fight smallpox, however, required injecting cow scabs into humans, and risking real illness. Although traditional vaccines have taken years to develop, scientists have harnessed a much faster method for the COVID vaccine. The technique, used to create both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, uses mRNA \u2014 or messenger RNA \u2014 to make harmless versions of the spike proteins found on the COVID-19 virus. In earlier vaccines, scientists had to make those proteins in a lab and then transfer them into the vaccine. With mRNA, our body produces the proteins \u2014 a vastly quicker and more efficient process. It does this so well because our body already knows how to make mRNA (and does all the time). mRNA is like a blank piece of paper that our cell nucleus encodes instructions into in order to make proteins that control bodily processes, like hormones. Our cell nucleus then \u201cmails\u201d the mRNA it\u2019s encoded out into the rest of the body. This process happens inside us every moment of the day.

Lots of people embraced the comfort of sourdough to get them through the frightening first months of the pandemic. Ironically, the reason we can eat bread at all is because thousands of years ago a virus helped us develop a new enzyme that made it easier to digest carbohydrates. Viruses have developed hand-in-hand with humankind, sometimes \u2014 as we\u2019ve seen with COVID-19 \u2014 to deadly effect. Humans have fought back, developing in the process the concept of vaccines, with the first effective, modern vaccine coming on the scene more than 200 years ago. Today\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines work in much the same way as those early inoculations but are safer and more effective. It\u2019s true that they were developed with historic speed \u2014 but only because they were built on decades of basic research that allowed us to deliver them in record time. #science #viruses #covid19 #vaccine #mrna technology 1692 notes ,\n         3 weeks ago Ready for the next big disaster? Here\u2019s what we do if an asteroid is headed to earth Asteroids hitting the Earth have been a staple of Hollywood blockbusters for years. But what happens if there actually was an asteroid hurtling towards us?\u00a0\n Luckily, there are people like Kirsten Howley, a Lawrence Livermore National Lab researcher, who has a game plan for dealing with this potential danger. And strangely enough, it doesn\u2019t seem to involve Bruce Willis. #space #asteroids #video #science #nasa 37 notes ,\n         3 months ago What Hollywood gets wrong (and right!) about protecting the Earth from asteroids In the 1998 movie, \u201cArmageddon,\u201d an asteroid the width of Texas is about to hit Earth. The heroes who stop it in just the nick of time are a group of orange-suited Americans, all men. Life isn\u2019t always like the movies. Not that an asteroid couldn\u2019t slam into Earth, mind you. Asteroids \u2014 mostly tiny ones \u2014 pass by our planet virtually every second. But the people charged with stopping the big ones aren\u2019t reaching for their spacesuits with mere hours to spare. And spoiler alert: They also aren\u2019t all men. \u201cI would say the number one question I get when I tell people what I work on, is \u2018Oh, like \u2018Armageddon?\u2019\u2019 And it\u2019s nothing like \u2018Armageddon,\u2019\u201d says Lawrence Livermore National Lab physicist Kirsten Howley, whose day job includes defending our planet from asteroids. Howley doesn\u2019t have an orange jumpsuit at hand, but her job is serious business. She and her team of planetary defenders specialize in how we might deflect an asteroid that poses a threat to Earth.

It was a victory built on generations of tireless advocacy, election day disappointments and spurts of progress across the country. One of the key elements to winning this battle was research, notably that of UCLA psychologist Evelyn Hooker. In the 1940s and 50s, when gay men could be arrested just for being gay, Hooker bucked the norms of her era and studied them like any other subject. Her groundbreaking work showed that being gay was not a mental illness.

One person we have to thank for that is UCLA\u2019s Dr. Evelyn Hooker, who sought to change the understanding of homosexuality as a mental illness in the 1940s.\u00a0 Her groundbreaking study showed gay people were not ill and in need of a cure.

In 2020, for the first time ever, the U.S. census will ask directly whether adults are involved in same- or opposite-sex married or unmarried partnerships, in order to improve the accuracy of information about the true number of same-sex relationship households in the U.S. Sixteen years after gay marriage first became legal in Massachusetts, and five years after it became legal across the country, it\u2019s a landmark achievement for those who have fought for decades to be recognized as equals. But, according to Kerith Conron from UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute, it needs to go further. She estimates that the census overlooks about  80 percent  of adults in the LGBTQ community. If you are a lesbian, but not living with a partner, or if you identify as transgender, you are invisible. If you are a bi- or queer-identified person living with an opposite-sex partner, you are also invisible. If you aren\u2019t living with a same-sex partner, you are invisible. This creates a huge gap in our ability to understand and provide services to the LGBTQ community, with a particularly high cost for transgendered people, who suffer from a lack of good data and corresponding resources.\u00a0 Their push for visibility in other surveys has made a difference, according to Conron: \u201cEven doing an analysis of federal funding for transgender research, I\u2019ve seen a major increase in the number of grants funded for transgender folks in the last 10 years.\u201d\u00a0 And it isn\u2019t as though we don\u2019t know how to ask these questions \u2014 the Williams Institute has even developed a  series of best practices  for doing so. Despite the shortcomings of the current census, Conron believes that it will eventually become more and more inclusive. \u201cI am confident that there are many people in federal government that believe inclusive data collection is a priority and that data collection will move forward,\u201d states Conron.

Studies show between 3 to 4.5 percent of adults identify as LGBTQ \u2014 compared to about 8 to 9 percent of teenagers.\u00a0 If only we had an incredibly powerful tool to validate this trend across the population.\u00a0 The thing is, we do: it\u2019s the U.S. census. But even its new and improved design makes it hard for us to understand matters of gender and sexual identity.\u00a0 Kerith Conron of UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute explains who the 2020 U.S. census is counting, who it\u2019s not, and why, in our new video. #lgbtq #ucla #lgbtq community #gay #transgender 96 notes ,\n         2 years ago \u201cTo fight sexual harassment, we must start with better wages\u201d Claudia Chi Ku is a single mother of\n four who works as a server, food-runner, and bartender at a popular \nMexican grill in Los Angeles. Like many in the restaurant industry, Chi \nKu faces sexual harassment daily, while averaging just $10 in tips per \nshift.  She tolerates more than she might \notherwise because she needs the money.  \u201cYou have to respond in a nice way so they don\u2019t feel bad,\u201d she says,\n \u201cIn the end, I depend on their tips \u2013 I depend on them being there.\u201d  There are more than 11 million restaurant workers in the United \nStates, and many of them have stories similar to Chi Ku\u2019s, said Saru \nJayaraman, director of the  Food Labor Research Center  at University of California at Berkeley and co-director or the  Restaurant Opportunities Centers United  (ROC-United).  The food service industry is notoriously hard on its workers, in part\n because the federal minimum wage is just $2.13 for people who earn tips,\n Jayaraman said.  Those rock-bottom earnings all but guarantee a climate in which food \nservers put up with customer harassment just to eke out a living, she \nsaid.
