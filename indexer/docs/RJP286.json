Quarantine  is used to keep someone\u00a0 who might have been \u00a0 exposed \u00a0 to COVID-19 \u00a0away from others. Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. People in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others, monitor their health, and follow directions from their state or local health department. \n Quarantine or isolation: What's the difference? What's the difference between quarantine and isolation? \n Quarantine  keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others. \n Isolation  keeps someone who is infected with the virus away from others, even in their home. \n Hidden \n \n \n \n \n Who needs to quarantine? \n \n \n \n People who have been in  close contact  with someone who has COVID-19\u2014excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months or  who are fully vaccinated . \n \n People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms. \n People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms. \n People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they have been  fully vaccinated  against the disease and show no symptoms. \n \n What counts as  close contact ? \n \n You were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more \n You provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19 \n You had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them) \n You shared eating or drinking utensils \n They sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you \n \n \n \n \n \n Steps to take \n \n \n \n Stay home and monitor your health \n \n Stay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19. \n Watch for fever (100.4\u25e6F), cough, shortness of breath, or  other symptoms  of COVID-19 \n If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at  higher risk  for getting very sick from COVID-19 \n \n \n \n \n Options to reduce quarantine \n Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to quarantine by reducing the time they cannot work. A shorter quarantine period also can lessen stress on the public health system, especially when new infections are rapidly rising. \n Your local public health authorities make the final decisions about how long quarantine should last, based on local conditions and needs. Follow the recommendations of your local public health department if you need to quarantine. Options they will consider include stopping quarantine \n \n After day 10 without testing \n After day 7 after receiving a negative test result (test must occur on day 5 or later) \n \n After stopping quarantine, you should \n \n Watch for symptoms until 14 days after exposure. \n If you have symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider. \n Wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands, avoid crowds, and take other steps to  prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n \n CDC continues to endorse quarantine for 14 days and recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus. CDC will continue to evaluate new information and update recommendations as needed. See  Options to Reduce Quarantine for Contacts of Persons with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Using Symptom Monitoring and Diagnostic Testing \u00a0for guidance on options to reduce quarantine. \n Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection of the virus that causes COVID-19 \n Cases of reinfection  of COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again. Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Facebook \n Twitter \n LinkedIn \n Syndicate \n \n \n \n \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast Updated Mar. 12, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content source: \t National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) ,  Division of Viral Diseases \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n home Your Health About COVID-19 plus icon Things You Need to Know How It Spreads plus icon Ways COVID-19 Spreads Reinfection Variants of the Virus Frequently Asked Questions Children & Teens plus icon MIS-C Info for Parents COVID-19 in Children & Teens Stop the Spread in Children Keeping Children Healthy Helping Children Learn Deciding How to Go Back to School Checklists for Going Back to School Talking with Children Resources for Parents Stress & Coping plus icon Coping with Stress Care for Yourself Helping Children Cope Reducing Stigma Grief & Loss Alcohol & Substance Use Support for People Experiencing Abuse Support for Veterans Support for Teens & Young Adults Funeral Guidance Pets & Other Animals plus icon Animals & COVID-19 If You Have Pets If Your Pet Tests Positive Interacting with Wildlife Guidance for Handlers of Service & Therapy Animals Basics of COVID-19 Symptoms plus icon Coronavirus Self-Checker Testing plus icon Testing for COVID-19 Test for Current Infection Test for Past Infection Self-Testing Contact Tracing plus icon How To Talk To Your Close Contacts Contact Tracing Steps Prevent Getting Sick plus icon Protect Yourself Get a Vaccine Masks plus icon Your Guide to Masks Masks Protect You & Me How to Wear Masks How to Store and Wash Masks\u200b Improve How Your Mask Protects You Types of Masks Guidance for Wearing Masks Mask Fit & Filtration Hand Sanitizer Wearing Gloves Cleaning Your Home Improving Ventilation in Your Home Protect your Home from COVID-19 Social Distancing Household Checklist Living in Close Quarters Living in Shared Housing If You Are Sick plus icon What to Do If You Are Sick Isolate If You Are Sick When to Quarantine Caring for Someone Sick Parents and Caregivers When You Can be Around Others Potential Treatments Long-Term Effects People at Increased Risk plus icon Older Adults Medical Conditions plus icon People with Asthma Pregnant People Adult Day Services Centers Alcohol, Drugs, & Substance Use Disorder plus icon People with Substance Use Disorder Resources for Organizations Breastfeeding & Caring for Newborns Caregivers of People Living with Dementia Limited-English-Proficient Populations People with Disabilities People with Developmental Disabilities plus icon Caring for People with Developmental Disabilities People Experiencing Homelessness People Living in Prisons and Jails Nursing Homes & Long-Term Care Facilities Refugee Populations Rural Communities Daily Activities & Going Out plus icon Choosing Safer Activities Participate in Outdoor and Indoor Activities Deciding to Go Out Returning to Work Running Errands Using Transportation Large Gatherings Small Gatherings Personal & Social Activities plus icon Voting Tips Holiday Celebrations plus icon Holiday Tips Holidays and Stress Doctor Visits & Getting Medicines Visiting Beaches & Pools Visiting Parks & Recreational Facilities Playing Sports Attending Sporting Events Food Safety In-Home Services Travel plus icon Domestic Travel During COVID-19 International Travel During COVID-19 plus icon Requirement for Proof of Negative COVID-19 Test or Recovery from COVID-19 for All Air Passengers Arriving in the United States When Not to Travel Safer Travel Tips Mask Requirement Travel Health Notices plus icon How COVID-19 Travel Health Notice Levels Are Determined Travelers Prohibited from Entry to the US After International Travel Travel Planner plus icon Travel Planner Instructions for Health Departments Cruise Ship Travel plus icon What CDC is Doing for Cruise Travelers Crew Disembarkations through Commercial Travel Ship Crew Well-Being Travel FAQs Communication Resources for Travelers plus icon Road Travel Toolkit for Transportation Partners Air Travel Toolkit for Airline Partners Southern Border Toolkit for Partners   \n \n   email_03 Get Email Updates     To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:           Email Address               What's this?
