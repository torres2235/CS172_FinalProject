Newsom\u2019s 2021-22 revised budget\t\t \n \n The University of California is deeply grateful to Gov. Newsom for proposing the largest state investment in UC\u2019s history: more than $807 million, which includes more than $506 million in ongoing funding for core campus operations, student needs and medical training. The budget, with the support of legislative leadership, reflects an earlier agreement to fully restore more than $300 million in budget reductions that were enacted in the 2020 state budget. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n @UofCalifornia \n \n \n . @ucriverside  historian Jorge Leal has taken a furtive step into documenting the Latinx community\u2019s emerging L.A. f\u2026  https://t.co/3GVXgmYXtB   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Priorities Spotlight Double the Pell \n Defending DACA recipients \n Civic Engagement \n Climate Lab \n Fig. 1 \n FirstGen \n Innovation and Entrepreneurship \n Student Opportunity \n Transfer Students \n \n Systemwide Programs UC-HBCU Initiative Programs \n President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program \n \n Presidential Initiatives Carbon Neutrality Initiative \n Global Food Initiative \n Smoke and Tobacco-Free Student Fellowships \n UC-Mexico Initiative \n UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement \n Undocumented Students Initiative \n \n \n UC System Overview \n Parts of UC \n Stewardship \n Working at UC \n Leadership Academic Senate \n Board of Regents \n \n Information Center \n \n Support UC Advocate About the UC Advocacy Network \n UCAN Student Ambassadors \n Federal Budget \n State Budget \n Research Funding \n Enrollment \n Education \n Campus Housing \n Health Care \n Student & Faculty Diversity \n \n Donate \n Connect Alumni Career Network \n \n \n More \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Become a UC Advocate \n \n Receive email alerts about issues that are important to UC and contact your legislators to ensure the university remains a hub of opportunity, excellence, and innovation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Admissions \n Jobs \n Contact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Facebook \n Twitter \n Tumblr \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You are here News Press Room UC President Napolitano denounces decision to end DACA program, calls on Congress to make protections permanent   \n Press Room \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Categories \n \n All News \n Research \n Health \n Arts & Humanities \n Students & Alumni \n Faculty & Staff \n Administration \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Other News \n Video \n UC in the News \n Press Room \n Health Press Releases \n Current Issues \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What makes UC unique? \n Extraordinary students from across California. \n Explore the data  if all of U C were just 100 Students \u00a0 > \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\tUC President Napolitano denounces decision to end DACA program, calls on Congress to make protections permanent\n \n \n \n\n\tUC Office of the President \n \n Tuesday, September 5, 2017 \n \n \n \n Share \n \n \n Share on Facebook \n Share on Twitter \n Share on LinkedIn \n Share on Reddit \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California President Janet Napolitano, U.S. secretary of homeland security from 2009 to 2013, released the following statement today (September 5) after President Trump announced his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: \n \u201cI am deeply troubled by President Trump\u2019s decision to effectively end the DACA program and uproot the lives of an estimated 800,000 Dreamers across the nation. This backward-thinking, far-reaching move threatens to separate families and derail the futures of some of this country\u2019s brightest young minds, thousands of whom currently attend or have graduated from the University of California. \n \u201cI call upon the U.S. Congress to immediately pass bipartisan legislation that would provide a permanent solution for these young people \u2014 one that charts a secure pathway toward citizenship and allows these Dreamers to continue to live, work\u00a0and serve the only country most of them know as home. These youth need our protection and encouragement, and it is incumbent upon Congress to approve legislation that removes the uncertainty caused by President Trump\u2019s misguided decision. \n \u201cThe University and the state of California stand together in our belief that students should be admitted to UC and other institutions of higher education based on their records of achievement and without regard to their immigration status.\u00a0President Trump\u2019s decision undermines the ability of affected students to support themselves while at UC or other universities.\u00a0In light of today\u2019s decision, I am immediately directing my advisory committee on undocumented students to determine how best to support and protect University of California students who rely on DACA over the next six months and beyond.\u00a0In the meantime, UC will continue to offer services to our undocumented students, including: \n \n Continuing\u00a0to allow California residents who are Dreamers to pay in-state tuition; \n Maintaining the DREAM loan program for financial aid; \n Offering legal services to our undocumented students; \n Supporting campus-based student service centers; and \n Directing campus police not to contact, detain, question or arrest individuals based on suspected undocumented status, or to enter agreements to undertake joint efforts to make arrests for federal immigration law violations. \n \n \u201cThe University of California will continue to stand with Dreamers and their supporters as we fight to keep the program alive.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n President Napolitano's letter to Congressional leadership \n Letter from California's higher education leaders to the Calif.
