About YouTube \n \n \n Our mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. \n We believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share and build community through our stories. \n \n \n \n Our values are based on four essential freedoms that define who we are. \n \n Freedom of  Expression \n We believe people should be able to speak freely, share opinions, foster open dialogue, and that creative freedom leads to new voices, formats and possibilities. \n \n \n Freedom of  Information \n We believe everyone should have easy, open access to information and that video is a powerful force for education, building understanding, and documenting world events, big and small. \n \n \n Freedom of  Opportunity \n We believe everyone should have a chance to be discovered, build a business and succeed on their own terms, and that people\u00e2\u0080\u0094not gatekeepers\u00e2\u0080\u0094decide what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular. \n \n \n Freedom to  Belong \n We believe everyone should be able to find communities of support, break down barriers, transcend borders and come together around shared interests and passions. \n \n \n \n
