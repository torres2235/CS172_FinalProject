      \n \n \n \n \n \n Overview \n Our Community Guidelines are designed to ensure our community stays protected. They set out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed and not allowed on YouTube, and apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails. \n You'll find a full list of our Community Guidelines below: \n          Spam & deceptive practices             Fake Engagement               Impersonation               Links in content               Spam, deceptive practices & scams                   Sensitive content             Child safety               Custom thumbnails               Nudity and sexual content               Suicide and self injury                \n          Violent or dangerous content             Harassment and cyberbullying               Harmful or dangerous content               Hate speech               Violent criminal organizations               Violent or graphic content               COVID-19 misinfo policy                   Regulated goods             Content featuring firearms               Sale of Illegal or Regulated goods                \n          More             Additional policies                \n \n \n How do we develop new policies and update existing ones? \n Each of our policies is carefully thought through so they are consistent, well-informed, and can be applied to content from around the world. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re developed in partnership with a wide range of external industry and policy experts, as well as YouTube Creators. New policies go through multiple rounds of testing before they go live to ensure our global team of content reviewers can apply them accurately and consistently. \n This work is never finished, and we are always evaluating our policies to understand how we can better strike a balance between keeping the YouTube community protected and giving everyone a voice. \n                       \n \n \n How does YouTube identify content that violates Community Guidelines? \n With hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to YouTube every minute, we use a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at scale. Machine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to find content similar to other content we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already removed, even before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s viewed. \n We also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate problems before they emerge. Our Intelligence Desk monitors the news, social media, and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before they can become a larger issue. \n \n \n Is there a way for the broader community to flag harmful content? \n Though we are determined to continue reducing exposure to videos that violate our policies and have tasked over 10,000 people with detecting, reviewing, and removing content that violates our guidelines, the YouTube community also plays an important role in flagging content they think is inappropriate. \n \n \n If you see content that you think violates Community Guidelines, you can use  our flagging feature  to submit content for review. \n \n \n We developed the  YouTube Trusted Flagger program  to provide robust content reporting processes to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise in a policy area, government agencies, and individuals with high flagging accuracy rates. Participants receive training on YouTube policies and have a direct path of communication with our Trust & Safety specialists. Videos flagged by Trusted Flaggers are not automatically removed. They are subject to the same human review as videos flagged by any other user, but we may expedite review by our teams. NGOs also receive occasional online training on YouTube policies. \n \n \n \n \n What action does YouTube take for content that violates Community Guidelines? \n Machine learning systems help us identify and remove spam automatically, as well as remove re-uploads of content we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already reviewed and determined violates our policies. YouTube takes action on other flagged videos after review by trained human reviewers. They assess whether the content does indeed violate our policies, and protect content that has an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose. Our reviewer teams remove content that violates our policies and age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. \n Community Guidelines Strikes \n If our reviewers decide that content violates our Community Guidelines, we remove the content and send a notice to the Creator. The first time a Creator violates our Community Guidelines, they receive a warning with no penalty to the channel. After one warning, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll issue a Community Guidelines strike to the channel and the account will have temporary restrictions including not being allowed to upload videos, live streams, or stories for a 1-week period. Channels that receive three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated. Channels that are dedicated to violating our policies or that have a single case of severe abuse of the platform, will bypass our strikes system and be terminated. All strikes and terminations can be appealed if the Creator believes there was an error, and our teams will re-review the decision. \n          Resources             Learn more about Community Guidelines strikes               Appeal a Community Guidelines strike                \n Age-Restricting Content \n Sometimes content doesn't violate our Community Guidelines, but may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age. In these cases, our review team will place an age restriction on the video so it will not be visible to viewers under 18 years of age, logged-out users, or to those who have  Restricted Mode  enabled. Creators can also choose to  age restrict their own content  at upload if they think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not suitable for younger audiences. \n          Resources             Learn more about
