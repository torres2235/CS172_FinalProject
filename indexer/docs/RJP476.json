It is now more important than ever that we shine a light on our own practices, including enforcement of the Twitter Rules and our ongoing work to disrupt global state-backed information operations. The public and policy makers want to be better informed about our actions and we recognize these calls for greater transparency. \n That is why our original report has evolved into a more comprehensive Twitter Transparency Center covering a broader array of our transparency efforts. We now include sections covering information requests, removal requests, copyright notices, trademark notices, email security, Twitter Rules enforcement, platform manipulation, and state-backed information operations.\u00c2\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Read more\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Browse the reports \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Reports overview\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Blog \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Insights from the 17th Twitter Transparency Report \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Read post\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Download Report 17 \r\n (Jan -
