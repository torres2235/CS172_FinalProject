No fully vaccinated person died due to COVID-19 during clinical trials of the three authorized vaccines.\r\n \n \n \n How vaccines work \n How do COVID-19 vaccines work? \n COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.\u00a0 \n If the vaccine you got requires two shots, be sure to get both doses so it can work fully.\u00a0 \n Vaccine safety\u00a0 \n COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be  safe  and  effective  in clinical trials. These vaccines were authorized only after it was found that they make it substantially less likely you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get COVID-19. \n How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines? \n The authorized vaccines are up to 95% effective against a person becoming ill with COVID-19. \n Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe? \n The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to  ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines . \n Safety monitoring after vaccination \n Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, using both  established  and  new safety monitoring systems . These vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. Learn more  facts about COVID-19 vaccines. \n Results from monitoring efforts are reassuring . Many people have reported only mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Some people have no side effects. \n You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine \n The vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19. \n Benefits of getting vaccinated \n \n \n COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help us get back to normal\r\n  \n \n Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine? \n COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. But they have other benefits, too: \n In the rare case that you do still get COVID-19, the vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill.\u00a0 Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you,  particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 . COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build immunity. COVID-19 can have  serious, life-threatening complications,  and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. \n COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help us get back to normal. \n Read more at CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine . \n \n What to expect after vaccination \n You may have mild side effects \n After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. Your arm may hurt where you got your shot or you may have redness or swelling. You may be tired or have a headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea. \u00a0They may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Learn more about  Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine . \n The CDC recommends women younger than 50 years old to be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after taking Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen. Read CDPH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Fact Sheet: Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks . \n If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to: \n VAERS  (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) V-safe  (After Vaccination Health Checker) \n When to call the doctor \n In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider: \n If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days \n If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about  COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions . \n \n \n \n \n What you can do once fully vaccinated \n \n \n \n You can: \n \n Spend time with other fully-vaccinated people, even indoors, without wearing masks or physical distancing \n Spend time indoors without masks or physical distancing with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease \n Travel domestically without a pre- or post-travel test and without quarantining after travel \n Travel internationally without a pre-travel test (depending on destination) and without quarantining after travel \n Take part in outdoor activities and recreation without a mask, except in certain crowded settings and venues \n Return to work following an exposure as long as you have no COVID-19 symptoms \n Skip testing if asymptomatic \n Skip quarantining following a known exposure if asymptomatic \n \n \n \n \n \n You should: \n \n Continue to follow the mandatory CDPH face coverings guidance, including wearing a mask and physically distancing in indoor public settings \n Get tested and isolate if experiencing COVID-19 symptoms \n Continue to follow the mandatory CDPH gathering guidance. Avoid large indoor gatherings, especially when they include those who are not fully vaccinated \n Avoid being indoors unmasked with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 \n Wear well-fitted masks when visiting indoors with unvaccinated people from multiple households, as permitted by the gathering guidance \n Follow COVID-19 guidance issued by your employer \n Continue to follow the Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards (ETS), if they apply at your workplace \n Follow CDC and health department travel requirements and recommendations \n \n \n \n \n See the CDPH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Travel Advisory  and  COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People  for complete details. \n \n \n \n \n Vaccine equity for hardest-hit communities \n California is allocating COVID-19 vaccines as they become available to ensure equitable distribution. \n We must end the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly and effectively as possible by vaccinating those most at risk of serious outcomes and those who have been most exposed at work or in their daily lives. By targeting vaccines to those who most need them, we can also begin to  safely reopen activities  across our economy. This will protect not just those who are vaccinated, but reduce additional community transmission. It will also help reduce potential new variants that might emerge. \n The  Governor announced seven equity strategies  in California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine rollout to protect hard-to-reach communities, address vaccine questions, and drive innovative efforts in communities hardest hit by the pandemic. \n \n \n \n \n Vaccination progress data \n \n \n GO TO DASHBOARDS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Spread the news about the vaccines \n \n \n \n Vaccinate ALL 58  is our state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 vaccination program for Californians in all 58\r\n        counties. \n Share that vaccination against COVID-19 is here.

Vaccine providers must obtain consent from a parent, legal guardian, or other adult having legal custody before vaccinating a minor. But there are some exceptions:\u00a0\u00a0 \n Emancipated minors  do not need the consent of a parent or guardian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Providers may accept written consent from a parent or legal guardian of an unaccompanied minor.\u00a0The written consent must verify the parent/guardian has been provided the  Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet . Phone or video consent is possible if the parent/guardian confirms that they have been provided the  Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet  or the Fact Sheet is read to the parent/guardian. \n Families should check with their vaccine provider on acceptable forms of consent. See CDPH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Pfizer Vaccine Minor Consent Guidance  for more details. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Why should I vaccinate my child? \n \n \n \n \n Cases in children are increasing. The  American Academy of Pediatrics  reports that youth now account for 22% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. This time last year it was only around 3%. It is important to get young people vaccinated to prevent new cases from increasing further. \n The more vaccinations, the more we stop the spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants and shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting our 12- to 15-year-olds vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n My child has had reactions to other vaccines \u00e2\u0080\u0093 should they still get the vaccine? \n \n \n \n \n Yes, unless they have had anaphylactic type reactions to components of the Pfizer vaccine.   Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are rare and very few people have had severe adverse reactions. If your child has allergic reactions to the flu vaccine or other severe allergies, you should report that to their health providers in advance of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and important to receive in order to overcome this pandemic.  \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Is there an increased vaccination risk to children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma? \n \n \n \n \n Youth aged 12 to 15 can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have underlying health conditions. If you have specific questions about a condition, please talk to your healthcare provider, local community clinic, or public health office. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Will my child be required to get vaccinated before returning to in-person schooling, especially in the fall? \n \n \n \n \n While vaccination isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t currently required to return to in-person learning, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective is to get as many of our 2.1 million 12 to 15-year-olds vaccinated prior to the new fall term. By getting our young people vaccinated soon, we can take comfort in knowing those over age 12 are protected against highly contagious coronavirus variants and COVID-19, both inside and outside of the classroom. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Will my child be required to get vaccinated before they can play recreational or school sports? What about returning to the band or theater or rejoining clubs? \n \n \n \n \n While vaccination isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t currently required to play sports, this is the time for our youth to join their teammates and friends in getting vaccinated so they can protect themselves and each other against COVID-19. The state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industry guidance provides guidelines to support a safe environment for  youth sports activities . \n The resumption of other group activities such as band, theater, and clubs will be coordinated by schools in concert with future state guidelines. Meanwhile, getting our young people vaccinated when they are eligible can help them return to the things they love sooner. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Why is the vaccine only for adolescents 12 and over? When do you expect vaccines to be available for younger children? \n \n \n \n \n Vaccine trials and approvals commonly begin with older, more vulnerable populations then extend to younger ages. Adolescents were the next group to be prioritized because they are most similar to adults and are more likely than younger kids to spread the virus and become seriously ill. This approach balances the need for safety and speed, while protecting our children throughout vaccine development. \n Both Pfizer and Moderna have ongoing clinical trials in people younger than 12. Depending on the outcome of those trials, authorization for this next age group could happen later this year. Johnson & Johnson is currently in clinical trials for the 12-17 age group. \n \n \n \n \n Vaccines allocation and distribution \n \n \n \n \n I\u2019m an employer and want to help my employees get vaccinated. How do I do that? \n \n \n \n \n The  Employer Vaccination Toolkit  provides all the information you need to: \n Partner with local providers for offsite vaccination events Request a worksite mobile clinic Help employees find and book vaccination appointments Share and promote resources that support employees in getting vaccinated \n \n \n \n \n Getting vaccinated \n \n \n \n \n How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed? Can I get my second vaccine shot at a different interval than recommended? Can I mix and match COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers? \n \n \n \n \n Ideally, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get: \n Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart\u00a0 \n The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine only requires one dose. \n If two shots are required,  get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible ,   but not sooner. However, if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over. \n You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mix and match different vaccines. Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free to the public. \n Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Know Your Health Care Rights . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine? \n \n \n \n \n No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How do I cancel or reschedule my vaccine appointment through My Turn? \n \n \n \n \n If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, you can do so on your phone or computer, using the SMS or email appointment confirmation notification you received after booking. On your phone, click the \u201cQR Code link\u201d in your SMS appointment confirmation.

The \u201c Manage your appointments \u201d page will open and you will be asked to confirm your appointment with your appointment confirmation number and either your cell phone number or your email address. \n After confirming, you will have the choice to cancel or reschedule your appointment(s). If you choose to reschedule both your first and second dose Moderna or Pfizer appointment(s), or your single-dose Johnson & Johnson appointment, you will have the choice to change the clinic, appointment time, and/or appointment date. If you want to reschedule your second dose only without changing your first dose, you will only be able to change the second dose appointment time. \n Once you have made your changes and click \u201cContinue,\u201d you will receive a new confirmation email and or text message. Your original appointment will not be changed unless you click \u201cContinue.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine? \n \n \n \n \n Yes. We do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19? \n \n \n \n \n No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the  criteria  for ending isolation. Those without symptoms should also wait until they  meet the criteria  before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible? \n \n \n \n \n Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to ensure sites and services are accessible in accordance with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine at home, if I am unable to travel to a vaccine site? \n \n \n \n \n Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy. \n If you cannot leave your home to get vaccinated, you can indicate this on  myturn.ca.gov  or when calling the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 hotline at  (833) 422\u00e2\u0080\u00914255 . If eligible, you will be connected with your local health jurisdiction to arrange for in-home vaccination services. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How do I get transportation to a vaccine site? \n \n \n \n \n If you do not have a way to get to a vaccination site, you can receive free transportation through  myturn.ca.gov  or by calling the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 hotline at  (833) 422-4255 . \n Transportation options include automobile transportation for ambulatory patients and non-emergency medical transportation for non-ambulatory patients, including wheelchair vans, gurney transportation, and other options. Medi-Cal managed care and fee-for-service beneficiaries will be connected with their health plan or service provider to get transportation through existing health benefits. \n You can also check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.\u00a0 \n If you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s member service department to request assistance for transportation to receive covered benefits. If you receive Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation (NMT) providers in your county and you can contact them directly to arrange transportation to your appointments.\u00a0 \n If there is not a provider in your area, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) can assist if you email them at  DHCSNMT@dhcs.ca.gov . Please do NOT include personal information in your first email. DHCS staff will reply with a secure email asking for your information about the appointment.\u00a0 \n If you have a need for Non-Emergency Medical Transportation, please inform your medical provider who can prescribe this service and put you in touch with a transportation provider to coordinate your ride to and from your appointment(s). \n \n \n \n \n What to expect after vaccination \n \n \n \n \n What is acceptable as proof of full vaccination? \n \n \n \n \n The following are accepted:\u00a0 \n Vaccination card, which includes name of person vaccinated, type of vaccine provided, and date last dose administered\u00a0 A photo of a vaccination card as a separate document A photo of the attendee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccination card stored on their phone Documentation of vaccination from a healthcare provider \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What does it mean to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cfully vaccinated\u00e2\u0080\u009d? \n \n \n \n \n People are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19 two weeks after they receive the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or two weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen). \n See CDPH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People  for complete details. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19? \n \n \n \n \n No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on  viral tests . \n If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on  antibody tests . Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine? \n \n \n \n \n California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified. \n Read more at CDPH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Should I keep my COVID-19 vaccination record card? \n \n \n \n \n Yes. We urge Californians to keep their vaccination record cards for themselves and their families in a safe place to prevent loss or damage. Individuals who need replacement cards should contact their vaccination provider for replacement.\u00a0You can request your  COVID-19 vaccination record  from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR). However, CAIR does not provide replacement cards. \n \n \n \n \n Vaccine limitations \n \n \n \n \n If I get a COVID-19 vaccine, will I still need a flu shot this fall? \n \n \n \n \n Yes. COVID-19 vaccine does not provide protection against flu. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine?  What about people with allergies? \n \n \n \n \n The  CDC recommends  that: \n If you have had a severe allergic reaction or an immediate allergic reaction\u00e2\u0080\u0094even if it was not severe\u00e2\u0080\u0094to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). If you have had a severe allergic reaction or an immediate allergic reaction to any ingredient in Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the J&J/Janssen vaccine. If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.\u00a0\u00a0 If you are allergic to PEG, you should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get the Janssen vaccine. If you are allergic to polysorbate, you should not get the Janssen vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. If you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to get one type of COVID-19 vaccine because you are allergic to an ingredient, ask your doctor if you should get a different vaccine.\u00a0 If you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to get the second shot of an mRNA vaccine because you had an allergic reaction, ask your doctor if you should get a different vaccine. \n People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines provided they have not had  an immediate or severe allergic reaction  to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Learn more about vaccination  considerations for people with underlying medical conditions.  Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19. \n To learn about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, see \n Information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Information about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Information About Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If I\u2019m pregnant or breastfeeding, should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? \n \n \n \n \n Yes.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  states that pregnant and lactating individuals can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts have not identified any safety concerns for pregnant or lactating people who were vaccinated or their breastfeeding babies. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the live virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19. \n Pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people.
