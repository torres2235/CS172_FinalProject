I am grateful to the Rose Hack team and  Major League Hacking  for giving us the opportunity and resources to crunch through 24 hours.\n\n\"GUARDIAN is always by your side. The app is designed to empower women through accessible SOS features, alerts to contacts and quick directions to safe places. With GUARDIAN, you'll never walk alone.\"\n\nI was in charge of designing the prototype of the app on Figma and built a REST API with Flask and Google Maps API that directs users to a safe place. I had no clue how an API was before this and even if we didn't win a Nintendo Switch, I would have walked away with fantastic friends and improved coding skills!\n\nAli Akber, Tejaswini Edidi and I hope to build a fully functioning version of the app in the coming months, so that it will become available on the app store. In the meantime, you can check out: \n- Our app prototype  https://www.figma.com/\u2026/dUWea\u2026/Guardian\u2026 \n- Our devpost  https://devpost.com/sof\u2026/guardian-gp83ix   See More Thang Bom January 17, 2020 at 7:24 PM would you please let me know the event starting at 11:am or 9:am.
