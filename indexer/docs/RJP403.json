Special emphasis this year will be on the impact of  Mathematical Biology on Translational Science  &  Promotion of   Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion . \n We are excited to virtually host the meeting on behalf of the  University of California Riverside  (UCR) along with the inclusion of most colleges and universities in California! \n While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the  Society for Mathematical Biology  is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2021 Annual Meeting in a virtual form between  June 13-17, 2021 . We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.  The meeting will be held  24 hours a day  to maximize the participation of people across the world. \n \u00a0 \n Please see the website for more information. \n \u00a0 \n https://www.smb2021.org/home \n \n Dial-In Information \n Registration Required \n \n \n  Sunday, June 13 at 9:00am\n           \n \n More dates through June 17, 2021 \n \n \n                Thursday, June 17\n                \n                  to 5:15pm\n                \n               \n \n  Virtual Event\n        \n       \n \n \n \n \n Event Type \n \n \n Conferences \n \n \n Audience \n \n \n Faculty & Staff , \n                \n                   Graduate Students , \n                \n                   Undergraduate Students , \n                \n                   Alumni , \n                \n                   International Students , \n                \n                   General Public \n \n \n Website \n \n \n https://www.smb2021.org/home \n \n \n \n \n Department \n \n Mathematics \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Subscribe \n \n Google Calendar \n iCal \n Outlook \n \n \n \n \n Recent Activity \n \n \n \n Comment \n Review \n Photo \n \n \n \n No recent activity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Join Stream \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Watch This\n             \n \n \n  I'm Interested\n               \n \n \n \n  Invite Friends\n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People Interested  \n \n \n No activity yet \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search for: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n                        900 University Ave. \n                        Riverside, CA 92521 \n                        Tel: (951) 827-1012\n                     \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n             900 University Ave.\n                             Riverside, CA 92521              \n \n                        Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n                        E-mail:  webmaster@ucr.edu \n \n \n   Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n RELATED LINKS \n \n Campus Map \n Transportation and Parking Services \n Riverside Convention and Visitors Bureau \n \n \n Follow us: \n \n Facebook \n Twitter \n YouTube \n Instagram \n LinkedIn \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2020 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This event content is powered by the Localist Community Event Platform. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Login to UC Riverside  Events Calendar \n \n UCR Users: \n You may login with your UCR NetID \n \n \n \n \n \n Login with School ID \n \n \n \n All Other Users: \n When creating an account, please create it with your first and last name, otherwise, it may be deleted. \n \n \n \n \n Login with Facebook \n Login with LinkedIn \n Login with Twitter \n \n \n \n \n \n Email Address \n \n \n \n Password \n \n \n \n \n Forgot Password? \n \n Sign Up \n \n \n \n Note on Event Submission: \n In order to submit events, users must have a UCR email address (@ucr.edu).
