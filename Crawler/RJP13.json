If you are able to do your job effectively without returning to campus, we urge you to talk with your supervisor about continuing to work remotely.  As more people get vaccinated and the overall level of new COVID-19 cases declines across the country, we are easing out of the worst public health crisis in a generation.  All returns to the workplace must be pre-approved.  If you have any questions or concerns about this, please speak with your supervisor. The guidance below applies to all employees who perform duties on campus or UC leased or affiliated properties, unless the facility has expressly provided different instructions. Deans and unit heads will determine which groups are needed to work in person. For those who are approved to return, we are instituting new protocols designed to protect yourself and others. We expect all on-campus workers to abide by the guidelines and directives described below. \n Supervisors \n Authorization .\u00a0 Provide authorization for each employee to report onsite.\u00a0 \n Worksite specific plan.

Learn more at\u00a0Facilities Services  Campus Return Support Information \u00a0view details on  cleaning schedule . \n Guidance Document and\u00a0Schedule \n Ventilation \n All campus buildings that are open to the public during normal times are safe environments. Some of our buildings are much older and have some limitations. Our buildings are designed to provide sufficient \nair changes based on building activities. We are making a special effort to ensure that all buildings have current filter changes. The information below is how HVAC systems are maintained. \n Expanded Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is expanding the length of time outside airflow will circulate throughout each building. \n Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each building. \n Air Flow: To accommodate efficient airflow in each building, the most advanced level of filters \nare being used based on the building\u2019s air filtration system capabilities. \n Building Ventilation \nStrict adherence to the public health posters and other visual cues throughout campus and in buildings will reduce transmission risks. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed even though \nbuilding occupancy will be reduced. This will further reduce the risk of potential airborne transmission.\u00a0 While each individual occupant of a campus building will want to make sure these guidelines are \nfollowed, including limited occupancy, it will be very important to ensure that all the other occupants in that building, at least on that same floor, coordinate to ensure the overall density and guidelines are \nbeing followed on a collective basis. \n Transmission Reduction Efforts \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the COVID-19 virus appears to spread human-to-human through respiratory droplets coming from an infected person. Based on public health guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include: \n social distancing, \n limiting occupancy, \n practicing good personal hygiene, and \n utilizing face coverings \n As part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be viewed by clicking  here .\u00a0 \n HVAC ventilation FAQ's \n Resources and SOPs \n Signage \n The campus has developed standard signage and postings for building entrances, exits, stairs, elevators and more. Download and post signage through your work areas. \n COVID-19 Campus SignaGE \n The following posters are installed throughout campus: \n Keep yourself healthy\u00a0 \n Face covering required \n Elevator (1 person maximum) \n Wait here (footprints) \n Do not use (this area is closed) \n To obtain additional signs complete the  COVID-19 signage request . \n Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) \n General Areas: Office Space General Area/Office Space Disinfection SOP \n Laboratories \n\tLaboratory/Research Space Disinfection SOP \n Facilities \n\tDisinfection response plan SOP \n Shared Vehicle \n To reduce the spread of COVID-19, avoid sharing UCR vehicles whenever possible. Employees may share vehicles only if approved in advance and in writing by a supervisor. Review this\u00a0 Shared Vehicle Guidance \u00a0for details. \n Visitors & Contractors \n We recognize that visitors, contractors, vendors and other non-UCR\u00a0personnel may need to come to campus. \n Contract employees working through third party employers must follow all campus protocols. \n Contract employees are required to continue following all Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI), such as masking, physical distancing, hygiene, daily wellness checks until further notice \n Contract units must complete and submit a copy of their WSSP or provide their employer\u2019s equivalent documentation to \u00a0 ehspublichealth@ucr.edu \n Non-UCR affiliated individuals coming to campus for essential work must abide by visitor guidelines.  \n Non-UCR Affiliate information\u00a0 \n Travel \n Employees who have travelled domestically or internationally, whether for personal or business purposes should refer to the following guidelines and restrictions regarding travel.\u00a0 \n Travel\u00a0Guidelines \n Parking \n Find the most up to date information on parking from Transportation Services \n Parking Information \n\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quick Links \n \n \n Campus Return \n \n Hotline \n \n UCR Daily Wellness Check Survey \n \n Human Resources COVID-19 Resources \n \n Student Health Services \n \n Campus Emergency Status \n \n Keep Teaching \n \n Keep Learning \n \n Keep Working \n \n Keep Researching \n \n Coronavirus Resources \n \n Face Covering Request \n \n Research Ramp Up \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search \n \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n 900 University Ave. \n            Riverside, CA 92521 \n Tel: (951) 827-1012 \n \n \n UCR Library \n Campus Status \n Campus Store \n Career Opportunities \n Diversity \n Maps and Directions \n Visit UCR \n \n \n \n \n \n University of California, Riverside \n \n               Environmental Health & Safety \n             900 University Ave.              Riverside, CA 92521              \n  tel: (951) 827-5528                  fax: (951) 827-5122          email:  ehs@ucr.edu   \n \n \n  Find Us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related Links \n \n \n Coronavirus Resources & Updates \n \n Customer Service Satisfaction Survey for EH&S \n \n Emergency Management \n \n Fire & Life Safety \n \n Risk & Safety Solutions Web Application Log In \n \n Risk Management \n \n UC Police Department \n \n UC Risk & Safety Training \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Privacy Policy \n Terms and Conditions \n \u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let us help you with your search \n \n \n Enter your Search Criteria. \n \n \n \n Search All UCR \n \n \n Search This Site \n \n \n Cancel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
